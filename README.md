# Milestone II - Music Project

**Project purpose**: This project aims to explore the dispersion of trends and themes through music. This could be further expanded to explore pre-and-post digital ages of music, along with geographic dispersal, and cross-language comparisons.

**Project overview**: By acquiring data from publicly-available sources (Discogs, Musicbrainz, Acousticbrainz, Genius, LastFM), we aim to assemble a feature-rich dataset with discography, lyrics, and metadata.

**Dependencies**:
Google Colab  was our shared working space. A Google Drive was created to faciliate easier file-sharing for working in this space.
File types: JSON, CSV, Notebooks, Python scripts
Required libraries: pandas, json, re, scikit-learn, os, pathlib, numpy, gensim, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib
