I’m talkin’ pedicures on our toes, toes
Tryin’ on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin’ up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin’, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin’ up to the parties, tryna get a little bit tipsy

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

Not how they should behave

Hard to obey

How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

Oh
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts and I can't seem to find your heart

Oh
I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again

Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?

If the past is the problem, our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man
