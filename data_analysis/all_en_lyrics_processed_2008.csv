Eight million stories, nigga
Take y'all niggas somewhere, man
Y'all niggas never heard niggas rhyme like this before, man
This ain't no Wizard of Oz shit neither, man
For real, man

[Verse 1]
Surgical gloves, snubs in the grass with his blood
""Homie, hold that"", the four black
We black down, Gold Jag'
Ol' laughing, yo, ""Yo, what the fuck happened?""
""They clapped him in the scalp, it flew that way""
""Yo, why they capped him?"" It went through his lap
Snatched his Audemars Pig-et, took his man gold, get at
He painted it, slayed blocks, aiming it, hit a child
This is foul, but he styled with his flamer, flaming shit
Teddy with the red Range, supercharged Kangols
Rae and Ghost CD in his change, yo
Angel, Spanish kid lingo, all I know is where he hang, though
Kept it sideways, angle
Good brush, tough talk, keep it real, daddy, got them thing-os
I respect on how the game goes
The same goes for get-fresh niggas, test niggas
Extra blessed niggas with them egos
We blow you out your peacoats
Haha, ah, dios míos, we get them twelve a ki, yo
Keep it moving, slide off in the G-Os
""Freeloaders, the D's over
Your shit won't sell no more, breeze over""


[Chorus: Raekwon]
Money, gear, drugs, guns, Goodyears
All my niggas sit, smelling the tears
Cooking snow white, it's just the poor life
Never living off fear, we all millionaires, now where my shares?
(Money) You know the code, drug money, gear money, baby
(Money) You know we fold the stash holders, cash blowers, yeah
(Money) So when the D's come, we float and grab the boats, yeah
(Money) Spend off, I got my win off, have a potent year

[Verse 2]
Yeah, X6 is red, up in Albany with the dreads
Bags of black, fuck the feds, papers in Arubas
Gold tuba from Bermuda in my living room spreads
Cameras, action, got the calico cranked
""Where the food at?"", Hood jewelry on, I gots to do that
Long-chain hatchet flooded up, you knew that
Baby blue Mac, stones on the nozzle stick
Bulletproof Broccos with the Jew bitches, all I got is two cracks
Gazelle lenses, clear rude wraps, bagging every Ziploc
And my peoples sit around, cops split that
High potent white Kit-Kats, we sell up in the hood
Going door to door, every floor, every get back
My gangsta shit, get gats, for every man
""Here go a gram
Meet me by my drophead and drop your lid back""
Forty-seven quick claps (Spray off on something)

I heard about a person
Who had a broken heart
With nothing to drive him on
No hope no spark no flame

He couldn't see at all tears
They were blinding him
He kept it all inside
The guilt and all the pain

You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but, ooh, it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize

We turn into super monsters that the H-Bomb can't destroy
We're bulletproof, nothing can stop us from trampling down this world

But paying for the damage is modus operandi
It's the grandest scheme for keeping people localized
I’d hold your hand if you weren't in Boston tonight
I would help entwine each separate finger
Into sensitive parts of the back of my skull

I can't blame you for never asking why
Because it can't be cut and dried like it’s from the butcher
But someone always gets drained just the same
I thought if I’d hide it all you'd like me better
The way you’d treat a girl you'll never see again

My house is a place where clothes are optional

On someone everybody can agree on
Someone that can use their heads, housewives don't get opinions
A modern day door knocking politician

You might as well dance 'cause one day you're all gonna die
And you should have fun before your untimely demise
You can't avoid the cold hand of death, so you should be out there enjoying yourself
We might as well dance, 'cause one day we're all gonna die

That's right, you could be richer than God, but you're still gonna die!
And you don't get no online friends in the afterlife
We often forget that life is short, so come over and dance on my front porch
We might as well dance, 'cause one day we're all gonna die

And that means all of the people in business suits
All the housewives addicted to tiramisu
And all the french actors like Gerard Depardieu
Well, they can come over and they can dance too, as long as they don't bring their attitude!

It won't kill you to be nice since you're already gonna die!
So cheer up, emo kids! Oh, it’s only gonna get worse!
You think life’s hard now?
Wait until you have to do your own taxes and your own laundry!

But as for now, it's all ages and admission is free
So, ignore your responsibilities
And if you pick up some jelly beans, then you can come over and dance with me

A pudgy kid, his name was Chuck
Once he had some M&Ms
And I asked if we could share

And then when I was walking home
A bee stung me on my head
I stopped playin' outside that week
Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly

I could never find a place to sit and munch

Found out I had a crush on Tara Weatherby
He told the entire school

Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly
And that's the reason I'm a music geek

Who needs real friends
When you can obsess over bands?
Who needs human contact
When you can hear what people sing about it?

Now I'm in my mid-twenties
And everybody's got nice stuff but me
I still have social phobias
But I'm workin' to get past them

And got a record deal and made some videos

Just sleep next to you tonight

Well, there's frost on the window
Right next to the pillow
That smells just like your hair
Oh, it's freezing in Florida

And I can't find slumber
Without you next to me

When your body's in it
Even when there's frost on the ground

I work down at the carwash, I drink each day at work
A few shots of Black Velvet and I get the cars all wet
I'm a drummer in a local cover band
My mom wants me to move out of her garage this year
But she don't understand how I can make the audience cheer
""Rock and rockin' motherfuckin' roll!
Hoist your beers in the air!
I don't mind 'Free Bird' for the encore!
Let's do the Time Warp again!""

Our group is named Banshee Loves Slaves In Heat
And we don't do drum solos but that wasn't up to me
And I think our singer is a genius in disguise
We've been at it since discussing Kiss back in junior high
He's just like Jim Morrison with a beer gut to match
He can sing like Axl Rose, just watch the audience clap!
""Rock and rockin' motherfuckin' roll!
Hoist your beers in the air!
I don't mind 'Free Bird' for the encore!
Let's do the Time Warp again!""

Now Henry Rollins once said that there's nothing sadder than
A forty-year old drummer in a local cover band
But nowadays he can only sell his records to
Aging punkers that still sport their Black Flag tattoos
Who won't admit that now their tattoos are looking pretty dumb
Whenever we play Skynyrd, all the hipsters sing along
""Rock and rockin' motherfuckin' roll!
Hoist your beers in the air!

I thought about settling down and meeting a nice gal
But she won’t understand all of my Journey decals
And the drumsticks that i once had signed by mister Peter Criss
I’m not lookin’ for Miss Wright but right now i’d take a near miss
‘Cause things get pretty lonely here in my mom’s garage
And drunken classic rock fans only take a man so far

She's addicted to ice water
She could drink it all day
It's how she chooses to bathe
Rinses out cups
And leaves a little bit of soap behind

It's cleanin' out her insides

What have I become?
Now I'm feeding her chicken
This has gotta stop
We've gotta think of the children
Her feet barely work
She can't pedal her bike
We watched movies under
The blanket that night

She had her eyes closed
And her face hidden
She'd laugh before the jokes were even written
She don't like coffee
She chugs the cream
She buys Slurpees for the undercover police

And it's true I ran away
From your button face
I was hoping that your type was just a phase
There's no London in Brazil
I think you're mentally ill
Please forget you love me, go away
Please forget you love me, go away


She braids her hair
By tyin' it in knots
Left her first husband
Cause she hated doin' the dishes
Pours ice water
Into small plastic coolers
Stays up late
Just to memorize the Simpsons

Add a zero to her age
And then
You'll realize how well she knows men
She don't like coffee

Named Donna Pinciotti
And I wanna take her home
And play a badass game of Yahtzee
Her real name is Laura
And I just want another chance
To not make so much noise
Next time I'm goin' through her trash
I'd make her a bowl of soup
Just to hear the girl say thanks
I'd bet fifteen million dollars
That she shags like a Minx
But I'm just a normal guy
So I'll never get the chance
To undo her polyester blouse
And get into those seventies pants

Laura you're my Demerol
I wanna wash you down with alcohol
Laura bе my Nembutal

I'm not obsessed
But I just got a tattoo
Of your name across my bicep
And if you don't have minty breath
I would get you a pack of Trident
We could dress up like Kiss
I wouldn't mind doin' your make-up
Or we could talk about Eric
And all the things that caused your break-up
And I even loved you
In that stupid GAP commercial
And if for a second
You might allow me to get personal
I kept a used tube of lipstick
You once threw away
And now I'm gonna clone ya'
Using your lips' DNA

I used to have another celebrity crush
She went by the name of Drew Berrymore
You might have heard of her before
She was in a lot of bad nineties movies
But one day that crush faded
I fell asleep in San Diego
And I awoke
After having a horrible, horrible dream
About her
Shaving off my pubic hairs
While humming the
Tune to some obscure Smashing Pumpkins b-side
Named “Slunk”
Oh, it freaked me out
But I got over it really quick
And I was down in the dumps for months, though

Out along the way
And I've checked 'em out
Back and forth, to and fro, hither, tither, near and far
All the live long day, but
Marc with a C just loves him a girl with glasses
And they don't always accept my sexual passes
But it's true that I love girls with glasses best

And nerdy girls are hot
A nerdy girl knows what kind of ice cream that I want

Oh and she reads books I can't pronounce
But either way I'd like to announce that

And I guess it sounds dumb unless it's happened to you
And you've never been in love with a nerdy girl

Climb over those tired fences
Put on your glasses, be a nerdy girl

Now I like From Justin To Kelly, but I hate American Idol

But I just cut my hair off, so don't you dare call me a hippie

And I don't stand for bullshit conformity
And the quiz said I've got me a wicked thing for Christian Slater
But that's not right, I don't swing that way
I just wasn't cut from that bolt of cloth

So, take off my clothes, it's time for bed, I'm fucking shit up like I've got tourette's
But it's not all the cursing, it’s just the fact that I vent
But dry off your face, ‘cause it’s time for work, while it's party time for the republican jerks
Well, wait a second. I heard that they stopped the war...
No, my intelligence was wrong

So write this down in your blog:
I walk real slow while the whole world jogs
The washer was broke so I bought Febreze
If you get what you give, how can I expect to receive?
I think it’s everybody else, but they all think the problem is me

Get out of bed and find another job
I'm twenty-eight and I've lost the plot
Or, maybe, I just read the script wrong
Go seek some help, get on some pills, it's a sure-fire cure for the mentally ill
I’m not addicted to them, they're just what the doctor prescribed...
It's even legal to take these suckers before I drive!


So write this down in your blog:
It's time to leave, it's time to say so long

I wanna ride on the rhythm
And groove to that nasty funky beat
And when it pumps I go crazy
I'm gonna make you get on up and move your feet
'Cause when the rhythm's right, it'll make you move all night
It's gonna keep you coming back for more
And when the beat is strong, you'll party all night long
You'll party 'til you can't take any more

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
I don't ever wanna stop

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
Cause it feels so good to me

I wanna ride on the rhythm

I don't ever wanna stop
Cause it feels so good to me

The L-A-Z-Y, step into the place, I'm
About ready for the rhyth-a-mic baseline
The remedy to put your butt in motion
Smooth your body just like lotion
Move your shoulders, shake that neck, huh
Lose control, I mean, what do you expect?
To just sit on your behind? Nah
We going forward, it ain't no rewind
'Cause some people think the rhythm is hype
Some people say it's just their type
Some give it up 'cause they can't resist
And some give it two snaps, a twist with a kiss
Yo, that's alright, whatever you like
Whatever you want, whatever you do, cool
Just get ready to do it, don't hide
Pump the rhythm, get ready to ride

I'm gonna dance to the music
Cause the music takes me where I wanna be
I wanna get down when I use it
Cause I know the boomin' beat will set me free

Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come, hippity-hoppity
They're here, they’re there
Pink elephants everywhere

Look out, look out

I can stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms

I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright

Chase ‘em away! Chase ‘em away!
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade

It's gonna keep you coming back for more

About ready for the rhyth-a-mic baseline
The remedy to put your butt in motion
Smooth your body just like lotion
Move your shoulders, shake that neck, huh
Lose control, I mean, what do you expect?
To just sit on your behind? Nah
We going forward, it ain't no rewind
'Cause some people think the rhythm is hype
Some people say it's just their type
Some give it up 'cause they can't resist
And some give it two snaps, a twist with a kiss
Yo, that's alright, whatever you like
Whatever you want, whatever you do, cool
Just get ready to do it, don't hide
Pump the rhythm, get ready to ride

Cause the music takes me where I wanna be
I wanna get down when I use it
Cause I know the boomin' beat will set me free

I wanna ride on the rhythm
And groove to that nasty funky beat
And when it pumps I go crazy
I'm gonna make you get on up and move your feet
'Cause when the rhythm's right, it'll make you move all night
It's gonna keep you coming back for more
And when the beat is strong, you'll party all night long
You'll party 'til you can't take any more

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
I don't ever wanna stop

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
Cause it feels so good to me

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
I don't ever wanna stop, no

I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop
Cause it feels so good to me


[Verse 2: Doug Lazy]
The L-A-Z-Y, step into the place, I'm
About ready for the rhyth-a-mic baseline
The remedy to put your butt in motion
Smooth your body just like lotion
Move your shoulders, shake that neck, huh
Lose control, I mean, what do you expect?
To just sit on your behind? Nah
We going forward, it ain't no rewind
'Cause some people think the rhythm is hype
Some people say it's just their type
Some give it up 'cause they can't resist
And some give it two snaps, a twist with a kiss
Yo, that's alright, whatever you like
Whatever you want, whatever you do, cool
Just get ready to do it, don't hide
Pump the rhythm, get ready to ride

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna dance to the music
Cause the music takes me where I wanna be
I wanna get down when I use it
Cause I know the boomin' beat will set me free
Cause when the rhythm's right
It'll make you move all night
It's gonna keep you coming back for more
And when the beat is strong
You'll party all night long
You'll party till you can't take any more


I wanna ride on the rhythm
I don't ever wanna stop

Drinkin tequila got flame in my system
I'm with the homies you know that I missed 'em

Can you keep up with me homie just listen
It's the next Monday, I'm back with my homies
We take out the bottles and we see the shawties
Keep eye on one girl and I'm using my expertise
Talking to her, yeah she vibin she feeling me
Vibin she feelin me
Patron on the rocks we will be by the bay
We got the Don Julio we do not play
Got some more liquor coming on thе way
Gotta be the one to takе another shot
And take it down
I'm running through these shots real fast now
All the homies keeping pace
They're taking shots without a face
They're gunning all these shots like right now
Tequila going into to me
I know that you are feeling me
So take another shot like right now
Everbody partying and
Everybody bodying they're
Downing all these shots like right now


[Verse: JEYLADO]
Set in dirty motion
Lessen my talk
Weak in my knees
Mama look at my walk
Takin’ my walls down slowly
Livin’ in the dark, it excite me
Sight me, with a aimsight
Slightly leanin’ with a bitch
To my close right
Keep a zip loc, when I slipknot
I thought high thots
Don’t get high thoughts
I taught them
I don’t play with Glocks
That lifestyle way too fuckin hot
I don't, I don't, uh
I don’t just pull up to no block
I don't
So I gotta keep the vest up under tees
When I fuck I slip it underneath
When I smoke it’s in my dungarees
When I sip my drink I sip it carefully

[Verse: DILLA]
I’m five seconds away
From grabbin gats and cockin back
Can’t expect me to front it
Four the fiends just smokin crack
Chargin threeple for tabs
What I got, you wish you had
Two bitches just enough
For the crew, paid in CAD
If she’s thinkin I’m the one
Then that bitch should call me daddy
I’m parked just up front
Rollin blunts off the addy
While I’m smokin L's, you take them
And that’s just the way it goes
Lil S hopped out the caddy
With 300 worth in snow
Got a pack of darts to hack
And cleanin plates up with my nose
Rockin back and forth and
Actin up I’m leanin for support
Needin bitches that be bad enough
To suck me like it’s sport
Fiendin bad but I can’t take no more
I gotta go to court
So now I’m runnin through these beats
Dealin bars I freshly pressed
With pen and paper passed it back
Went ahead and saved the rest
I said, test me tread with caution

414,The Definition,87.0,Jumping All Over The World,2008,Scooter,Electronic,"Trance, Jumpstyle",2504759,UK,discogs,"3 ContributorsThe Definition LyricsJumping is an ability that most humans
And many animals share to some degree

It is the process of getting one's body off the ground
For a short time using only one's own power

Usually by propelling oneself upwards via contraction
And then forceful extension of the legs

In some cases the height of a jump may be increased by using
A trampoline, or by pushing down by the arms when playing leapfrog

One can jump up to reach something high
Jump over a fence or ditch, or jump down
And one can jump while dancing, and as a sport

But jump also is a synonym for an exciting style of dancing
Just to freak out for some time

Now listen to the sounds of Rick, Michael and the Chicksterminator

Please

In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down

Save me, save me, save me from the

And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further

How do you do, oo-hoo
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you

[Verse 1]
Start the danger, rearranger
Not so cool. Mercy
I'm the vapour on the radar
Get up on the mic and shout it, yah (Move it!)
I spit bricks got the kicks in the mix
My pricks long out the rigs
For the English, like Jackie X
No diggedy diggedy HP
I'm the bad boy, roll MC, so sexy

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you do, oo-hoo
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na

Won't let you go. Me got the flow
Mix up the show, Shalak!
K nami nama, like a hammer
A burning candle, fixed up with the spanner (Move it!)
I slip chips, rapping in da mix
Wanna see your trip split kicks
For da hits with the lyrical tricks
No diggedy diggedy diggedy, listen
Got a late night, early morning mission

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How do you do, oo-hoo

Tired curled up in bed
Waiting for something to happen

So he sits there all alone
Waiting for that golden sun in the Morning Light

Just let go - Just let go
Last year's gone so leave it all behind

So he tells me his last year
And what he'd like to change
I say to get down to the beach and to give us a call
He hears nothing at all

So he sits there all alone
Waiting for that golden sun in the Morning Light

Just let go - Just let go
Last year's gone so leave it all behind

But I made sure to overindulge in sex and drugs and rock and roll
But the sex produced a child, the drugs only worked for a little while

I tried to die young which made up ten miles of bad road
Which leads to a nice place to visit if you don't run into anyone you know
‘Cause we all know how people talk, you southern belles just can't refrain from flapping your jaws
The rumors still abound about the nights when I was trying to die young

When there's nothing left to carry, there’s nothing left to carry at all

I couldn't leave a good lookin' corpse just yet
‘Cause I hadn't left enough behind to live on
My next work will always be my best
The next record will always be my last

Sold what I owned, came home in a storm
Found out an old friend died in decal form
I take what I want from a store, then I walk out

You need what they ask you to need, you want what they sell

I can't spend the money I make on things that don't exist
I won't read your articles; if conditions persist, I will resist

We may not be right but we're not wrong
You're not right and we're not wrong

And I'll give you Bee Thousand on cassette from '94

Into sensitive parts of the back of my skull

I can't blame you for never asking why
Because it can't be cut and dried like it’s from the butcher
But someone always gets drained just the same

The way you’d treat a girl you'll never see again

My house is a place where clothes are optional
I'm horizontal when you think I'm upright
I'm living in a habitat where pixels understand
That I'm only a man in broad daylight

[Chorus]
Shield your casino eyes from what I claim as mine
What you don't know is never gonna hurt you
When I say good night, that's when I feel alive
What you don't know is never gonna hurt you

[Verse 2]
We went out to Walker Road, a tent that we could use to vote
On someone everybody can agree on
Someone that can use their heads, housewives don't get opinions
A modern day door knocking politician

[Chorus]
Shiеld your casino eyes from what I claim as mine
What you don't know is nеver gonna hurt you
When I say good night, that's when I feel alive
What you don't know is never gonna hurt you

[Instrumental Bridge]


[Verse 3]
The bus can be collateral for things that I don't have
Everyone I need’s in the backseat
Trailer parks and CB names, a sex that never stays the same
The outer shell that's never seen a JPG

That message reads as follows…”

You might as well dance 'cause one day you're all gonna die
And you should have fun before your untimely demise
You can't avoid the cold hand of death, so you should be out there enjoying yourself
We might as well dance, 'cause one day we're all gonna die

That's right, you could be richer than God, but you're still gonna die!
And you don't get no online friends in the afterlife
We often forget that life is short, so come over and dance on my front porch
We might as well dance, 'cause one day we're all gonna die

And that means all of the people in business suits
All the housewives addicted to tiramisu
And all the french actors like Gerard Depardieu
Well, they can come over and they can dance too, as long as they don't bring their attitude!

It won't kill you to be nice since you're already gonna die!
So cheer up, emo kids! Oh, it’s only gonna get worse!
You think life’s hard now?
Wait until you have to do your own taxes and your own laundry!

But as for now, it's all ages and admission is free
So, ignore your responsibilities
And if you pick up some jelly beans, then you can come over and dance with me

And when the therapy's done, what can I expect?
Maybe medication
But in the meantime I seclude myself, I distract myself
Otherwise I'm gonna cry all day
And when the therapy's done, and I'm all cried out

A pudgy kid, his name was Chuck
Once he had some M&Ms
And I asked if we could share
Instead he pushed me off of my Big Wheel
I skinned my knee and he rode off
And then when I was walking home
A bee stung me on my head
I stopped playin' outside that week
Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly
And that's the reason I'm a music geek
It never stole a Big Wheel from me

In sixth grade I always dreaded lunch
I could never find a place to sit and munch
There was this kid named Bo
Who once let me sit with him
One day he interrogated me
Found out I had a crush on Tara Weatherby
He told the entire school
When she found out she laughed at me
I stopped tryin' to make friends that week
Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly
And that's the reason I'm a music geek
It never points and laughs at me


Who needs real friends
When you can obsess over bands?
Who needs human contact
When you can hear what people sing about it?

Now I'm in my mid-twenties
And everybody's got nice stuff but me
I still have social phobias
But I'm workin' to get past them
Maybe if I went out and booked a few more shows
And got a record deal and made some videos
On second thought, I think I'll stay inside
With my girl and sing song for her
Cause she's in love with me
She loves to download mp3s
And she's in love with a music geek
She likes me for me",en,"There was this kid that used to beat me up A pudgy kid, his name was Chuck Once he had some M&Ms And I asked if we could share Instead he pushed me off of my Big Wheel I skinned my knee and he rode off And then when I was walking home A bee stung me on my head I stopped playin' outside that week Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly And that's the reason I'm a music geek It never stole a Big Wheel from me In sixth grade I always dreaded lunch I could never find a place to sit and munch There was this kid named Bo Who once let me sit with him One day he interrogated me Found out I had a crush on Tara Weatherby He told the entire school When she found out she laughed at me I stopped tryin' to make friends that week Instead I listened to my Walkman incessantly And that's the reason I'm a music geek It never points and laughs at me Who needs real friends When you can obsess over bands?

And she's my best friend
I'm her biggest fan
If she's happy and she knows it
She'll always clap her hands

Lay her down to sleep

Taking that leap

Not like Oscar The Grouch

What can I do?
I'll find the nearest thrift store and I'll
Start to peruse
Through their used records, all of those
Vinyl memories
Well, they might be all scratched up
But they still sound good to me
Now you might want

The latest Eminem CD
But I'm gonna settle for King of Rock
By Run DMC
It'll run ya twenty dollars for some
Avril Lavigne
But for a dollar I'll take Tapestry
By Carole King

And I like music on records the best
Yeah, and once you get that fever, it's a never-ending quest

Now CDs can be convenient
Yeah I guess that's true
But it's not the way that I prefer to
Jam out to The Who
You take that live Nirvana record for instance
It even comes with an extra track
Cause Kurdt knew rock 'n' roll sounds better
On 12 inches of wax

And I like music on records the best

That's no excuse
Marc With A C just happens to know where you can find one of those used
Pretty cheaply too

I look at my family and what I put them through
I would like to take the time out to apologize

They get their landscaping done at least twice a week

Well, I'm not saying that I'm pеrfect, I've got lots of room to grow
And I don't mean to sound holier than thou

But I play songs to one town and I hardly venture out
People sing the words back to me almost twice as loud
Sometimes I'm embarrassed by my songwriting archive
But right now I'm just happy to be alive

My body's full of H2O
I'm 29 but none of my hair is falling out
I'm not saying that I'm perfect, I've got lots of room to grow
And I don't mean to sound holier than thou

Once I spent an unexpected night inside a jail
It was hard to spend the night away from my email
But I lit up a cigarette and I waved the cops goodbye

And your stomach hurt from the Walker's Red Label

And bet me your record label's advance

But nobody cares about the songs that you sung
‘Cause the ones you wrote and just gave away

Named Donna Pinciotti
And I wanna take her home
And play a badass game of Yahtzee
Her real name is Laura
And I just want another chance
To not make so much noise
Next time I'm goin' through her trash
I'd make her a bowl of soup
Just to hear the girl say thanks
I'd bet fifteen million dollars
That she shags like a Minx
But I'm just a normal guy
So I'll never get the chance
To undo her polyester blouse
And get into those seventies pants

Oh, Laura I need medicine
Laura be my Vicodin
Laura you're my Demerol
I wanna wash you down with alcohol
Laura bе my Nembutal
Laura you're my Tuinal
Laura is my bag of reds
Oh, Laura is my favoritе redhead


I'm not obsessed
But I just got a tattoo
Of your name across my bicep
And if you don't have minty breath
I would get you a pack of Trident
We could dress up like Kiss
I wouldn't mind doin' your make-up
Or we could talk about Eric
And all the things that caused your break-up
And I even loved you
In that stupid GAP commercial
And if for a second
You might allow me to get personal
I kept a used tube of lipstick
You once threw away
And now I'm gonna clone ya'
Using your lips' DNA

Laura you're my Demerol
I wanna wash you down with alcohol
Laura be my Nembutal

Laura is my bag of reds
Oh, Laura is my favorite redhead


I used to have another celebrity crush
She went by the name of Drew Berrymore
You might have heard of her before
She was in a lot of bad nineties movies
But one day that crush faded
I fell asleep in San Diego
And I awoke
After having a horrible, horrible dream
About her
Shaving off my pubic hairs
While humming the
Tune to some obscure Smashing Pumpkins b-side
Named “Slunk”
Oh, it freaked me out
But I got over it really quick
And I was down in the dumps for months, though
What brought me back?
Laura Prepon
Now the skies are sunny
And we all have more traditional family values
My life would be nothing without you, Laura
Laura...
I need medicine

And a question crossed my mind
While I watched your rerun tapes
I just gotta know
Does the carpet match the drapes?
Laura I need medicine
Laura be my Vicodin
Laura you're my Demerol
I wanna wash you down with alcohol
Laura be my Nembutal

I've seen a lot of girls
Out along the way
And I've checked 'em out
Back and forth, to and fro, hither, tither, near and far
All the live long day, but
Marc with a C just loves him a girl with glasses
And they don't always accept my sexual passes
But it's true that I love girls with glasses best
That might just make me prejudiced
So I wrote a song about it
Here it goes...

I raised my eye just to inspect her
While she adjusts her pocket protector
There ain't nothin' wrong with a nerdy girl
She's the kinda chick that I'd like to make
But she's busy thinkin' 'bout anime
Lord, there's nothin' like a nerdy girl

A-one, two, three, four

She's a fan of Tori Amos
I'm tryin' to be cool just like John Stamos
Lord, there's nothin' wrong with a nerdy girl
She don't drink no gin and juice
But I imagine her in her Underoos
Oh lord, there's nothin' like a nerdy girl


Oh and nerdy girls are sweet
And nerdy girls are hot
A nerdy girl knows what kind of ice cream that I want

Oh and she reads books I can't pronounce
But either way I'd like to announce that
Lord, there's nothin' wrong with a nerdy girl
She could bring out the best in me
But I'm busy checkin' out her pair of B's
Lord, there's nothin' like a nerdy girl

Oh and nerdy girls are cute
And nerdy girls are smart
A nerdy girl can straighten out the wheels on my mental shopping cart
Rock!

Well, a regular gal just ain't gonna do
And I guess it sounds dumb unless it's happened to you
And you've never been in love with a nerdy girl
Girls, put away those contact lenses
Climb over those tired fences
Put on your glasses, be a nerdy girl

Well, the truth is I'm really a pterodactyl in a human body
Cause otherwise I'd be extinct!

I love my girlfriend, and I love the occasional B movie
Now I like From Justin To Kelly, but I hate American Idol
What the hell is wrong with Marc with a C?

I know I'm in love with everyone I know
But I just cut my hair off, so don't you dare call me a hippie
I'm in love with everyone I know
But I can't seem to figure out anything about myself, so what'd I do?

I went out and I took an online personality quiz
Where it turns out I'm Veronica Sawyer from the late eighties movie Heathers
And I don't stand for bullshit conformity
And the quiz said I've got me a wicked thing for Christian Slater
But that's not right, I don't swing that way
I just wasn't cut from that bolt of cloth
Even though I like Pump Up the Volume, I hated his movie Kuffs
You can't even find that movie down at Stardust

And all the people that cut me off on the way to work

And ask yourself, honestly, ""When was the last time I called my mom?""

And if I was there, I woulda kicked some ass
Cause for a guy that wears glasses, I can really serve some shit
You'd be surprised!
But afterwards I would've had to tell them

That I'm in love with everyone I know
Even if you go to monster truck rallies, drink Busch beer, and beat up moms!
I'm still in love with everyone I know
And that's just not PC to say in this day and age
If you said ""Marc, why are you in love with everyone you know?""

And laugh about the band when they go out of style

Well I ain't gonna change, man
You're better off not thinking you’re a doctor
I won't turn my head and cough
‘Cause you've only got your balls and your word in this life, well

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
[Verse: Carmen Winstead]
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's

It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all
When in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
Her come da police, Captain Tom Collins
And the rapper said freeze
He said ""hands in the air and hand over your keys""
Now we did, and that was kinda simple
Now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Marguarita
He said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Marguarita, cause yoh, she was flyer
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver
Now Im not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all

Te-Te-Te - Tequila

Here we go again and Im not fussin
See I'm a French Mexican but I can get with White Russians
At the bar with a drink in my hand
In walked Jose Cuervo what was marguaritas man
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old english
He said ""you'd better think fast
Cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glass""
He gave me some advice and it went like this:
""catch the night train and head up to 'cisco""
I didn't wanna stick around
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'
Was sippin Ice Teas on Long Island
I blacked out and the party came to a halt
Cause I was drinking the Tequila with the lemon assault Y'all

I woke up in the morning and felt like a Zombie
The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games
We played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles & James
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill
Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill
They took her $1000 mink and she could barely think
Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental
A groupie is a girl that jocks
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon
Now everybody take a word from the wise
A girly and a bottle, Tequila Sunrise

Gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit he runs wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye...

Wordlessly watching he waits by the window and wonders at the empty
Place in-side

Heartlessly helping him-self to her bad dreams he worries did he hear
A goodbye or even... hel-lo?

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
[Verse: Carmen Winstead]
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's

And the lies he keeps telling anyone

And the voice that you hear in the distance

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
[Verse: Carmen Winstead]
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's

Let me occupy your mind as you do mine

It makes it easier, easier on you
That much more difficult for me
To make you see

[Verse 1]
You've been gone much longer than you
Ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait 'til you come home

Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day you're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'll wait patiently
For your return
You're coming back!

But every time I fall
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
I'm looking for a catch
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
I know you're coming back

You've been gone so long you're fading
And it takes all the time I can find just retaining
Thoughts of things we did while you were here
But I know you will return my dear

Mow mama yama glory, Hallelujah
Mow mama yama glory, Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
The sun burns a hole through the 6am haze
Turns up the volume and shows off its rays
Another dodger blue skies is crowning L.A
The city of angels is blessed everyday

[Pre-Chorus]
That lucky old sun smiles on me
Wanna slide down the mountain to the dancing sea

[Chorus]
I'm listening to the morning beat
It's rising from star-studded concrete
The city has my favourite soundtrack
It makes you wanna move even though it's laidback

[Post-Chorus]
Take it in stride, it'll kickstart your feet
When you're tuned in to the morning beat

[Verse 2]
Driving through the maze of the Hollywood Hills
Headed to the ocean for a view that could kill
Watching from the wheel at Santa Monica pier
A million diamonds floating on heavenly tears


[Post-Verse]
The gentle wind won't make a sound
Even though it's forcing the waves to pound
Mow mama yama glory, Hallelujah
Mow mama yama glory, Hallelujah

Hear those guitars gently strumming
Hear those voices softly humming (humm)
It's hard to feel down
Living in this town
But you're so far away
It's a long, long way from January
All the way to December

[Verse 4]
Even when the sun and I head off to sleep
There's an unspoken promise that we keep
We'll pilot our light into another day
And keep a golden glow warming up L.A

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when dreams are deep and sweet
I'm listening for the rhythm of the morning beat

[Chorus]
I'll listen for the morning beat

I had this dream
Singing with my brothers
In harmony, supporting each other
Tail winds, wheels spin, down the pacific coast
Surfin on the A.M., heard those voices again

[Refrain]
In Southern California
Dreams wake up for you
And when you wake up here
You wake up everywhere

[Verse 2]
In the flow of the ocean
And the warmth of the rays
Heard music in the air and in the waves
The wind chimed, laughter rhymed
We had nothing but time
In Southern California
I heard the voice of my mind

[Refrain]
In Southern California
Dreams wake up for you
And when you wake up here
You wake up everywhere


[Bridge]
Oh, it's magical
Living your dreams
Don't want to sleep, you might miss something
Oh, it's magical
I'm glad it happened to me
Fell asleep in the band room
Woke up in history

[Verse 3]
Surfer silhouettes
The sun went into the sea
As we headed home, we drove into a movie
Love songs, pretty girls -
Didn't want it to end
Tried to slow down the motion
So it could move us again

[Refrain]
In Southern California
Dreams wake up for you
And when you wake up here
You wake up everywhere

At night, they would go walkin'

For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches
Where the witches are, and they say
""There are ghost towns in the ocean""

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin'
While we froze down below

By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

(I can't be so sweet to you)

Come on come by me
You look so good you know
You look so good for the summer
I wanna stroke your ego
And dress you like a prom queen
While you're hanging tight on my attitude

The whole box, show me something
Hey girl, can you tell me something?
Every time I stumble, it's your tiny face I see
You might just make a cheater out of me

Glass on the carpet, your legs on the couch
And all you wanted is my love in your mouth
You're so bearable, such a little acceptable
While possibly incredible
I want fun ???
I wanna taste you like you're fucking edible

(I can't be so sweet to you, until I find the right excuse)
(I can't be so sweet to you)

Cathedral ceiling, chandeliers
Eleven diamonds hanging from your ears
Eyes like colored pencils drawing into me
Every time I struggle you're the only face I see


Taking pictures of herself with her phone
Click, click sugar stick, leave the queer alone
Around the corner, confidentially
You might just make a cheater out of me

You're blacker than lacquer
And smarter than jean
And when you drink too much
You're condescendingly mean

With a dark haired guy on a motor bike

Talking really loud about how you're in love

The first three days always feel the same
You see your weekend coming and you're planning your fun
You can't get excited until your week is done

You raise your glass to your mouth but don't take a sip
Just touch the glass to your bottom lip
Well, all the guys at the bar keep staring you down (downtown)

For reasons we just can't say
We’re hiding up all our money
When the tax man comes to prey

We keep hiding and hiding and hiding
All our bits and precious barbs
We‘re hiding all our freckles
Our wrinkles and dead end jobs

We keep hiding and hiding and hiding
From all our hope and fear
Until hate boils through us
And there’s no one left to care

Well, we hide from what we want
So poisonous and soaked in sin
Oh, we hide from even our thoughts

Well, we duck and we dodge, we pocket and cover
All our scraps and ticks
Hiding up all our lustful needs
So they won't know our kicks

We keep hiding and hiding and hiding
Under blankets inside our bed
We nervously chew up our pencils
Until our teeth are stained of lead

We keep nestling to people like teddy bears
Because the good book said
""Well he who holds to soft things
Won't die before they’re dead.""

Come on come by me
You look so good you know
You look so good for the summer
I wanna stroke your ego
And dress you like a prom queen
While you're hanging tight on my attitude

The whole box, show me something
Hey girl, can you tell me something?
Every time I stumble, it's your tiny face I see
You might just make a cheater out of me

Glass on the carpet, your legs on the couch
And all you wanted is my love in your mouth
You're so bearable, such a little acceptable
While possibly incredible
I want fun ???
I wanna taste you like you're fucking edible

Cathedral ceiling, chandeliers
Eleven diamonds hanging from your ears
Eyes like colored pencils drawing into me
Every time I struggle you're the only face I see


Taking pictures of herself with her phone
Click, click sugar stick, leave the queer alone
Around the corner, confidentially
You might just make a cheater out of me

It starts when it ends
You've got all of your work days
To play with your friends

You're blacker than lacquer
And smarter than jean
And when you drink too much
You're condescendingly mean

Well, I saw you leaving the other night
With a dark haired guy on a motor bike
All my friends said they saw you drunk in the club
Talking really loud about how you're in love

Hey Tina, you're much meaner
Than you ever were to me before
You're so bitchy, you make me itchy
Can't you just turn me on some more and more, so much more

Now, it's already Wednesday, Tuesday never came
The first three days always feel the same
You see your weekend coming and you're planning your fun
You can't get excited until your week is done

You raise your glass to your mouth but don't take a sip
Just touch the glass to your bottom lip
Well, all the guys at the bar keep staring you down (downtown)
Just another see-through guy in town

Till we put the katanas on their grill
Then they be like nah nah nah nah
Nigga you don't wanna go against the clan
Cause we locking down Japan
Careful who messing with

[Verse 2: Gizmo]
I'm charged up nigga call me Sasuke not Drake
Heat another rapper like a soufflé partake
In assassin missions with infinite ammunition
I'm driven to park these niggas we pull up like a hand brake
Their hands break they can't lift bars this heavy they green we ready Go wilder than the Serengeti I'm there already
Earn my stripes Krueger Freddy
Y'all Niggas trying to sleep on me keep dreaming ha

These rappers just all sound so funny
Why rap y'all should just be comedians ha
Sell out for that Dave Chappell money
They gassed up so I'm charging a premium
Padawans ain't moving with the force right no foresight
Spread dogma in this dog bite a lost life
No continues this the boss fight
おいまじで他のラッパー俺食うぞ

Rep like I’m paying for rent though these scriptures
Verses on the kippur words paint a picture
But I’m Dalai when I’m silent bloody with the violence
Nihilist flow tears from my eyelids
Boy they feel salty sun on my back so sultry
Sword syndicate‘ll slice you up like some poultry
Blade leave me glad like glade when I move through the shade Lookin blade if you mad then assault me


Whatchu heard you think you know about it?

Mind is cloudy need the kama sutra
Call ya girl my karma lookin' sutured

You don't ever ask me why
You don't read the signs
You give me way too many reasons
For me to wanna get high
Standing tall between my four walls
And I'm about to fall
So look into my eyes and I
Say it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I am lost, I am lost
So crucify me on your cross
What's the cost, what's the cost
To erase what I've been taught?

[Chorus]
Get off my back, don't attack
So what if I fell off the tracks?
Your master plan don't understand
I'd rather live in my own wasteland

[Post-Chorus]
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
My own wasteland
I don't belong, I don't belong
My own wasteland


[Verse 2]
Scream at me until I shut down
Don't hear a sound
Can only take so many cheap shots
Down on the ground
I gotta go my own way this time
Leave you behind
Said it all but not enough for your
Simple mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I am lost, I am lost
So crucify me on your cross
What's the cost, what's the cost

Both you and I have always kept it bottled up inside
Can you show me what it feels like (Feels like)
To give yourself away?

[Pre-Chorus]

There's no one around who picks me up when I'm down like you do
(Why can't I hold on?)
And when you can't hear a sound will the silence melt you too?

Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation
Is this how we say goodbye?

Keeping secrets somewhere down below (Down below)
I wish you had the heart to tell me that you sold your soul
So many things you couldn't let me know (Let me know)
You had to run away

I was sick of restrictions, sick of the boundaries
About to close the door
Such a lack of conviction, no real connection
What should I settle for?
But you caught my attention, you built on the tension
And you left me wanting more
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you (Can't get enough of you)

Running through my veins
You're so contagious
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure
There is no cure

I saw your intentions, I gave you permission
Go ahead and start the war
I was out of addictions by my own admission
Oh, I've been keeping score
But you made an exception, you taught me a lesson
Who cares where I've been before?
You would never leave me all by myself, all by myself
You don't want nobody else

I saw you in the garden

Now there's no where else to go

But I couldn't find a way to help you grow

And your moods, they always change
I really tried to make it real, but you
Never had the faith
I tried to give you something good
To take the pain away

But the sun has gone away
Tell me why those clear skies so suddenly have changed

There's room for me

Oh, I dream of yesterday
So caught up in the past

And dry up all your tears

They will disappear

And the storm that you've been hiding from will end

You must have pulled the trigger
Your eyes give you away
The gun in your hand still smoking
You don't have to take the blame
You have to do what you have to do
You know I'd never judge you
Still time to close those eyes, forget what happened, forget you lied

Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
Don't take it off till everybody's gone
Put the mask back on, put the mask back on
The disguise is everlasting so long

Cover up, cover up
Don't let them see the real you
If your secrets can't stay silent
All those rumors might just end up being true

[Verse 2]
You're free to do what you want
You never thought of consequence
You created your own little world
Where you could always be different
A place were the rules do not apply
You could never be denied
You took advantage of a good thing
And now the void you build is empty

You opened up my eyes
Do you want to share your dreams?
See a different side of me
You're everything I need

And in a world of black and white

Come on and take my hand

No one to catch your insecurities

So attached to the feelings that you fake

You pushed them all away
You know you never allowed yourself to grow
Are you angry at me now that you are exposed?

I can't think straight

Just run from focus til i can't see

Why am i the one
Resenting everyone i love
Don't wanna fake another smile
Don't ever want to see you move on

CHORUS
Why is it everything is all the same
Even through all the fame
I stand beside myself inside of a joke
Even when i admit to take the blame
And tarnish my own name
The guilt inside me causes myself to choke

All these dreams in me
Achieved but still i don't feel complete
All alone somehow
This time there's nothing stopping me now
I'll reach my arms outside the windows
Catching any breath i can
I'll need the strength to lie about
My perfect promised land
These words embodying them all
As herds of dolls before the fall
Caked up in makeup
Tracing circles in the sky until i call


Coming to my senses
Losing all i never had
I'm burning each and every photograph
To keep from looking bad
Saving faces i've forgotten

I'm hoping, i'm wishing but i won't pray
All wet, soaking it up
I can take a lot of pain but enough is enough
Inside, trapped myself
My god i never thought that this could happen to someone else
Six hits, loving it rough
But no one ever knows if you cover it up
And you fall down, don't make a sound
Lights out, i don't know what you're talking about
This time i lost tonight
But tomorrow's the chance to make it right

My mind is going blank
And i can't recall a reason or a soul that i should thank
New world i won't embrace
A dimension that's preventing me from keeping the pace
Slowed down you'll grab the knife
And dissect the little decencies installed within my life
Another answer that i can't face
You may forget my body but not my face
I know i'm a disgrace
But there is no peace until i die

CHORUS
All the scenery is strange
Gone a year i'll face the change
There is nowhere left for me
So let it be

In the end we'll face that fact
My futures gray and i can't see

Falling over, going home
But moving foward as I spoke

Deserving every moment. I said

Take a step backwards and give me the strength

Kill yourself and live happily after

Full of toxins and insects, it's failing to take

Why do you worry so?
There's no reason to quarrel
No reason to go
If you feel sorry, baby
Then I know why
Somebody's been messing with your mind
And made you cry
And made you cry
I'm the doctor
I can help you along
Give you some sustenance
I'll keep you strong
Come into my surgery
It's on the very top floor
You'll feel so quiet there
You'll want to go and see
And have some more
There's flowers in my garden, baby
But it's alright now
I've saved all the flowers, baby
I've kept them for you
They're in a big Chinese bowl, baby
On the top of the stairs
They match nicely with the curtains
And they look well with the chairs
I've good intentions, baby
I don't mean you no harm
I've given you my word, my baby
I've given you my lucky charm
One forceps
One pair of knives
One pair of goggles, baby
Two glass eyes
So, when you see me, baby
I don't want to see you cry
That would only hurt me, baby
Only make me lie
My intentions are unsure now
I'm all qualified to lie
I have myself a bright white coat
I can help you to fly
Alright, the next patient, Miss Faversham
Is someone we know very well
We saw her out in the garden with the flowers
And she was crying
But she needs help
And I've told her to come to the top floor
Where I reside and sit amongst the magazines
The Novas and the Woman's Owns
Reside with me
'Cause I'm the doctor
Yeah, I'm the doctor
It's a sleepy lagoon
On a tropical island we will go to
No thoughts of cruelty, no hurt or pain
And the coconuts bouncing by
The coconuts bouncing by

[Verse 1]
When they got back they could breathe underwater
From racing the black cat and letting it win
They summoned the moon from the sky into the apartment
And frequented tunnels that don't have an end

[Chorus]
How low can this really know?
How slow can this all go?
How fast can the grass grow?
How far out did you wanna go?

[Verse 2]
It cut my throat on the curve of the earth
Took me apart, see how it works
Out in the era with eyes in the back of its head
Back on the ground, can't remember what they said

[Chorus]
How low will this really know?
How slow can this go?
And how fast can the grass grow?
How far out did you wanna go?


[Bridge]
Past your league, that force is free
And the tropic of shakes can erase the state
Your style has no tomorrow
Astrological straits changing your pace

[Refrain]
I can get lost and get found
Fall in the woods, no one's around
I don't make a sound
If i get lost i get found
Except for in town

People get lost and get found
Fall on the street, make a big sound
Everyone's around
People get lost and get found
They don't make a sound

Picture this
A father
He is a necromancer
He can bring people back from the dead
He can bring people back from the dead
He had three triplet daughters
Two are alive, born and bred
One of them is dead
And these girls are very special
One can see in the dark
And one can breathe underwater
I've set up the story for starters
Now, here's the father
""She's gone, girls, she's dead""
""Can we bring her back?"" they said
He said, ""You can but it's hard. It's really hard
You have to want to""
""What can we—""
""You have to play the—""
""With all your might
With all your might
It will sound right.""

When they see me off in traffic they say ""Jeezy on some other shit""
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Me, I'm in my spaceship, that's right, I work for NASA
This FNH is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
""Call that bitch your bodyguard?"" Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it, come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah, I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Hat back, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super-sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flying down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, ugh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was fronting when they knew he was broke
They say, ""Damn, Yeezy, Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me""
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
I ain't lying
So lonely, I ain't lying

Got lost hunting Coon
In the Carolina Mountains
Somewhere outside of Boone
We were just about to panic
When 'ol Lendyl saw the sign
It said, ""Come on in! The whiskey's fine.""

That old shack looked abandoned
Roof all fallin' in
Just some pertrified planks
And some rusty ol' tin
We both likely crapped our britches
When a voice from inside
Yelled, ""Come on in! The whiskey's fine.""

Then those swinngin' doors opened
He staggered out on the porch
Dressed just like Davey Crocket
Beard clear down to the floor
He said, ""The band's drunk, beer's skunked
And we ain't got no wine
But come on in! The whiskey's fine.""

We peeked in over his shoulder
And the first thing that we saw
Was a boy pickin' a banjo
In a pair of overalls
He said, ""That boy is half crazy
Plays the same song all the time
But Hey come on in! The whiskey's fine.""


""The food will make you sick
The air will make you choke
The waitress ain't a-workin'
And the Jukebox is broke.""

He said, ""the band's drunk, beer's skunked
And we ain't got no wine
But come on in! The whiskey's fine.""

He said, ""The pinballs won't roll
The pool-table rocks
And it hotter than two rats in heat
Inside an old wool sock.""

""I wouldn't drink the water
It tastes like turpentine
We're WAY overpriced
And a little hard to find.""

I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, 'cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no on else can

Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now

When I talk to my friends in privacy
""Who she think she is?"" Look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Yeah, but I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

A change gonna come and it's well overdue

I don't intend to be the guy that you leave behind
But we don't know how much
Of a journey we got

Barely worth the pain
Imagine we'd stayed at home together
Watching the dark and stormy weather
Would we regret that act forever?
Well you know we would!

Sometimes we never start
I see a door I start walking
I'm better alone than apart

It tells me how to hear and see
Compels the worst result to be
I wish I could tear it from me
But then my twisted heart turns round
And looks for pieces on the ground
Though now the silence is profound
It's mine to keep

I've never been wrong when I'm winning
'Cause losing's just not in the frame
You made some kind of resistance
Yet surely you entered my game

But then my twisted heart turns twice
And cools these fires into ice
Though now I have to pay the price
Of every brutal deed

Nothing ever got too crazy
Nothing ever got too cruel
Nothing ever comes from nothing, my dear
Too easy for me to be playing the fool to you


But then my twisted heart unfurls
And shows the ruins of my world

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks, Chris Brown]
If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air (No)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Jordin Sparks]
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow, I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks & Chris Brown, Jordin Sparks]
So how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Oh, oh)
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

I'm all alone tonight, no stars are shining on me
I'm thinkin' I'd be alright if somebody would just call me, yeah
I know that I'm not crazy, everybody must get this way sometimes
So look around for the people in your life that say

[Chorus]
Save me
I need somebody's help here
Thought it would be alright
But I'm not pulling through on my own
Is anyone around who can save me?
I'm falling down, it's crazy
If this is the pain God gave me
I'm cool with that
But won't somebody save me?

[Verse 2]
I guess you missed the signs
But honey, I can never blame you
I don't want you feeling guilty
That'd keep you in pain too (Ooh)
Now I can't hear you when I'm far away, away
So maybe you could learn from this
And help somebody else someday
'Cause I'm human after all
And I could not catch my fall
And nobody ever came around my way to check up on me
And see if I was doing alright
Nobody came to save me (Nobody, nobody)

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now it's been twenty-five years or more
I've roamed this land from shore to shore
From Tyne to Tamar, Severn to Thames
From moor to vale, from peak to fen

[Verse 2]
Played in cafes and pubs and bars
I've stood in the street with my old guitar
But I'd be richer than all the rest
If I had a pound for each request

[Pre-Chorus]
For ""Duelling Banjos,"" ""American Pie""
It's enough to make you cry
""Rule Britannia"" or ""Swing Low""
Are they the only songs we English know?

[Chorus]
Seed, bark, flower, fruit
They're never gonna grow without their roots
Branch, stem, shoots
They need roots
Yeah, yeah


[Verse 3]
Well, after the speeches, when the cake's been cut
The disco's over and the bar is shut
At christening, birthday, wedding or wake
What can we sing until the morning breaks?

[Pre-Chorus]
When the Indians, Asians, Afro-Celts
It's in their blood, below their belt
They're playing and dancing all night long
So what have they got right that we've got wrong?

[Chorus]
Seed, bark, flower, fruit
Never gonna grow without their roots
Branch, stem, shoot
We need roots

[Post-Chorus]
And haul away boys, let them go
Out in the wind and the rain and snow
We've lost more than we'll ever know
'Round the rocky shores of England
Haul away boys, let them go
Out in the wind and the rain and snow
We've lost more than we'll ever know
'Round the rocky shores of England
We need roots
We need roots


[Verse 4]
And a minister said his vision of hell
Is three folk singers in a pub near Wells
Well, I've got a vision of urban sprawl
There's pubs where no one ever sings at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyone stares at a great big screen
Overpaid soccer stars, prancing teens
Australian soap, American rap
Estuary English, baseball caps
And we learn to be ashamed before we walk
Of the way we look and the way we talk
Without our stories or our songs
How will we know where we come from?
I've lost St. George in the Union Jack
It's my flag too and I want it back

Tryna keep her from the US but she stronger than a gang
Cause she got a lot of fame messin' with the wrong name

My city on fire ain't no need to put it out
And I'm bout set it off its like I power in my mouth
And I'm bout to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be your nature girl
I feel the rain and it's tellin' me to go far
I feel the pain and it's tellin' me the music hard
Should I stay, should I go I don't know I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success I'm really sorry if you don't
Neva take drugs but I'm highed up

I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cookin' pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay-Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just got off my visa
I live everyday like it's the first of October

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
Start with your head homie then use your hands
If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
From the third world countries to the second and the first
It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
I wake up in the morning with my bitch in the bed
She don't like the police and she sure hate the feds
I love my girl cause she gives me what I want
She ride in the trunk or either ride in the front
She looks like 22 but she really 45
Some reason she done made a whole lotta niggas cry
So bad that she make ‘em all pull they money out
Take it out they pockets and they put it in my pouch
Ouch! gotta hurt the way that girl do ya
She always wanna what take, take, take the moolah
Gimmie them pesos the cash and the credit card
Might be a broad but the lil' bitch hit ya hard
You the police and we is the robbers
You need more than them helicopters to stop us
Excuse me, let me introduce my lady
Her name is Beretta and she mothafuckin crazy!

Met a woman on the corner said yo come in my door
Heard the rhythm of the music pumping up from through floor

When i walked through the party it was ready to go
There were punk rockers reggae rockers all in a row
Windin and a grindin through the dj show
The woman from the corner I was getting to know

Down to cape town where i be doing my thing
Then i be gone to uganda tanzania
Off to sudan and glad to see em

Some people try to make a deal to get a little bit more but they try to take it. Some of them end up in debt, when their called they try to fake it, but one morning the clock will chime and no more birds come flying by and tempretures keep rising higher, 16 bullets come flying by
Ai yi yi put your hands up high coz' you never know how long your gunna live till' ya die
They hit you with a missile, hit you with a bomb, hit you with the law try to take your home. Break into your house in the middle of the night, track you on a cell phone by satellite, stopped any time you're in your car, search your body search your home an' listenin' in on your phone calls. Still no politician got enough balls, lining the people up against the wall. When the truth comes out all hell will call and someday guantanamo will fall, until that day we all will ride on
Ai yi yi put your hands up high coz' you never know how long your gunna live till' ya die
Thats life in the city, Thats life in the city yeah, Thats life in the city, mad world in the city
Some holdin' on, so damn gone their whole lives livin with their tv on, then radio play the same 10 songs, set your clock by which ones on an watching the news try to see whats wrong, find sombody else to blame it on. Hope they never come and reserch you coz' your grandmother was an immigrant too. So if you love somebody better tell them so coz you never ever ever no when they gonna go, if they love you back, just give thamks, can't keep love like money in the bank

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, keep bringing it the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight, you got to put up a fight

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight

You got to put up a fight, you got to put up a fight

Boom, boom, there's a battle going on in this earth
Everyday, work, school, death and birth
There are 6 billion people on this earth
Can you tell me what every single life is worth?

Take a slip, look around and see history
My weapon and my method is no mystery
I didn't come here to chill, I came here to rock
To smash the empire with my boom box

You got to let go of remote control

You got to put up a fight, you got to put up a fight

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
On a universal mission like a meteorite
Satellite, laser beam with you in their sights
And with the PATRIOT Act they took all your right

Don't ever doubt the power of just one mind
Or the world wide power of just one rhyme
Don't ever doubt the force of the bass line
Or a record gone round to burn the house down

Ayy, uh-huh, woo (That's right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

[Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson]
I say, ""Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way""
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (I know) one thing (One thing), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (It's true)

[Verse 1: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson]
I've been a lot of places all around the way (Yeah?)
I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always callin' my name (Okay)
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you gettin' down, girl, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes, I knew it was true (Hahaha)

[Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson]
I say, ""Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way"" (Uh-huh)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (I know) one thing (One thing), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (Haha)


[Verse 2: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson]
Now, I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned, you can (Okay)
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes, and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you (Rockin', rockin', woo)
Dancin' in the night light in the middle of June
My momma told me, don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you (True)

[Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson]
I say, ""Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way"" (You Promise?)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know (The more I see, the less I know)
But I know (I know) one thing (One thing), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I say, ""Hey momma, hey momma, close to you""
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, ""Hey poppa, hey poppa, close to you""

All the birds they used to come to fly here
Come to die here

Tell me why I need to know
Sometimes I wish I didn't have to know
All you've shown me

Hey world, what you say
Should I stick around for another day or two?
Don't give up on me, I won't give up on you
Just believe in me like I believe in you

Tell me why, on the corner
All the kids that used to come to run here
Load their guns here

And tell me why it's okay to kill in the name of the Gods we pray

They Talk about the future like today will never last
Thay talk of the future while their diggin' through your trash
Taxman come to remove your cash
They talk of the future like a criminal plans
Corporate robberies in far off lands
They tell you the future's a big wonderland
And that homeland security's got a career for you
Don't you believe what they told you before
It's the same frikin' lies that they'll tell you some more
They searchin' your bag as you're boarding the plane
And they telling your neighbors that you went insane
I wouldn't believe that this was all coming true
If I could not see with my eyes that it's true
Even still I hope the future gets here soon
Bring it on bring it on

The future's comin' on like a bomb
The whole worlds rockin' and the beat goes on 2x
Ready or not we're bringing it on
The whole world's rockin' and the beat goes on

They take all your privacy give it away
And for musical piracy lock you away
They tell you that war is a permanent thing
And American Idol kids really can sing
Potheads on a rescue mission
Put your cancer in remission
People starving, malnutrition
Work your abs into condition


Oh no now they after your soul
And they're telling you now that you're losing control
Well its true cause I just got sick of it all
They say the savior's comin he's down at the mall
He's signing some autographs and selling them all
Pick up the phone now and make the call
I wouldn't believe that this is all coming true
If I could not see with my eyes that it's true
Even still I hope the future gets here soon
Bring it on bring it on

The future's comin' on like a bomb
The whole worlds rockin' and the beat goes on 2x
Ready or not we're bringing it on
The whole world's rockin' and the beat goes on

Stay for Tomorrow
Stay For Tomorrow

Smoke from barrels and rubber
Blazing from state to state

Backseat is filled up with hookers
Riding with the Devil tonight

You've been hunted down and captured
Now you can chug the brew
Hitch-hiking girls in the night
This ride will end it for you


The hood is covered in blood stains
Roadkill's piling up in a stew
Give it up little girls
The Cadillac is coming for you, tonight

Blueprint of hate
Blueprint of death
Evidence will soon unfold

Another trail left cold
Searching
Body still not found
Searching
Discovery too unreal

News is in
Only bones remain

One after another
Horror
The gruesome three are found
Horror
Decaying bodies lay

The wolf has struck again
This is the work of a madman
The true face of evil

Your time is up
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The noose is set for your demise

Convict at any cost
We must
Lay them to rest
We must
Grant the request
The end will justify the means

A mother cries out

A turn for the worse

Like walkin' into a dream
So unlike what you've seen
So unsure, but it seems
'Cause we've been waitin' for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light
But girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life, and realize this is going too far

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here

Place of hope and no pain
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place, but refrain
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right
(Up with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong, and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
Gave me your hand, but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand, I have to leave and carry on my own life

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right


[Bridge: M. Shadows & The Rev]
Loved ones back home all cryin' 'cause they're already missin' me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be

Oh, Lord, I'll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me

(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong)
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James)

[Verse 1]
Back in the day, they used to say:
""Play that song, get it goin'"" and the band played
And still today, you hear us say
""Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ""
Though times have changed, it's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna set the mood (Set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah


[Chorus]
Here we say now
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train (take it back, take it)
Back in the day, back in the day
Aw baby, back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it)

They still remain my inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door

I made you think you don't understand

[Verse 1]
I used to think that happiness could only be something
That happened to somebody else
Everybody believed, everybody but me, yeah, yeah
And I've been hurt so many times before
That my hope was dyin', so sick of tryin'
Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah, yeah
But then you came into my life, you opened up my softer side
And I could see into your eyes
And suddenly, I realized

[Chorus]
I made you think you don't understand
All the times you didn't understand
Why you couldn't just be my man
I made you think you don't understand
There were many walls you had to climb
If you really wanted to be mine
I made you think you don't understand
After all the hoops I put you through
Now I see that I'm in love with you
Now, I hope you finally understand


[Verse 2]
So many tears I had to cry
But you had many more of your own you had to dry
But you stuck it out and you're here with me now, yeah, yeah
And rememberin' the days I pushed away your love
You called my bluff and you still stayed around
Yeah, you figured me out
Said, you got me down
And there's no way to lie to you, you know me better than I do
Baby, ooh, you see me through
I'd be no good without you

[Chorus]
I made you think you don't understand
All the times you didn't understand
Why you couldn't just be my man
I made you think you don't understand
There were many walls you had to climb
If you really wanted to be mine
I made you think you don't understand
After all the hoops I put you through
Now I see that I'm in love with you
Now, I hope you finally understand
Oh

Baby, won't you listen now?
Can't you see just what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Said, baby, won't you listen now?
Can't you see just what I'm talking about?
Time went on, and I was wrong
To keep my distance for so long
So afraid, you wouldn't stay
But you never turned away
Always right by my side
You're forever in my life
Don't you go, 'cause now I know
That in you, I've found a home
Now I can see into your eyes
Suddenly, I realize


[Chorus]
I made you think you don't understand

I can tell that you're into me, uh
Baby, it's so plain to see
I can see it in your eyes
You're paralyzed every time I pass you by
You're the kind that gets your way, uh
Every minute, every single day
I can see it all in your face
You're blown away
'Cause I don't want you in my space

[Pre-Chorus]
You're struttin' 'round here
Like you think that I can't do without you
You got some nerve to think that I would give up everything


[Chorus]
Slow down, baby
And don't act crazy
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (Just can't touch, no)

Slow it down (Slow down, baby)
Slow it down (Slow down, baby)
Ooh, slow, slow
(Stop, slow down, baby)

[Verse 2]
After all of the games you play
How's it feel to finally get a taste?
You can dish it out but can you take the bed you've made?
Go lie in it for a change
I'm not fallin' for your stupid lines
I know you've used 'em 'bout a thousand times
You say 'em like they were a nursery rhyme
But I won't buy it
Baby, don't you even try

[Pre-Chorus]
You're comin' 'round here
Like you think that everything's about you
If you knew anything, you'd realize I wear a ring


[Chorus]
Slow down, baby (Slow down)
And don't act crazy (Crazy)
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (You just can't touch, no)

Boy, you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone (With someone)

Don't you have better things to do with life?
Hey, hey, whoa
Listen, I don't wanna get you down
But I ain't never gonna mess around
So how many ways do I have to say

Slow down, baby (Slow it down, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
If you see me walkin' down the street
Or in the pages of your magazines
Lookin' just a little differently
Showin' off a softer side of me
They saying I'm looking like a lady
They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everythin' you see
I gotta let the naughty in me free, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough (Get enough)
Tryin' to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later, somethin's gonna erupt us, 'cause...

I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (Still got it)
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me (Yeah)

And if ya want some more, sexy

And if ya still want it with me, still got it
No matter what you're thinkin' of me, still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

[Verse 4]
Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without bein' called a million things?
They say I'm not the girl they used to know (Used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (Oh)
But don't be fooled the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm lettin' loose, givin' a private show (Don't you know?)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to pass judgment, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware 'Cause...

I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree

Don't tell me to behave
'Cause I'll never play that game (No)
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
(Never gonna be uptight like you)
Don't look at me that way (No)
'Cause I ain't never gonna change (Hey, yeah)
And if you're talkin' 'bout my life (Ooh)
You're only wasting your own time
If I wanna wear lingerie outside of my clothes
If I wanna be erotic in my own videos
If I wanna be provocative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

[Chorus]
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (Thank you, ooh)
For all that you've done and still do (Still do)
You got me, I got you
Together, we always pull through

[Post-Chorus]
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother


[Verse 2]
It was the day that he turned on the kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Sayin' over and over and over
""You deserve much more than this""
She was so sick of believing the lies, and tryin' to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (Cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life (Oh), she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

[Chorus]
Oh mother, we're stronger (Hey, oh)
From all of the tears you have shed (All of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back (Yeah)

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again
For every time he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today

The song was released as the third single from the album.[Intro]
Hm
After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it


[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, uh-huh, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it


[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)
It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)

To think about her life while she's alone
And then she moved out west, out to Austin
To see why cowboys always live alone

Here we are unbroken
And here we are much the same
Here we are...

Oh you're never gonna get it so get it right now

And all we are is all we are
We're the same

I wouldn't lie...

She spent some time out there in California
(and I'd sing)
This could be something incredible
Or not worth my time
Then she listened to me in disguise
I never knew she paid attention
With Florida on her mind


All I know
I need you back so I can take your breath away
Back before the day that all this went away
Those times meant everything
I'd give up everything for this now

And all we are is all we are
The same

You got a brand new song and a summer tan
With so much to do I've got fifteen dollars

They do it down on Camber Sands
They do it at Waikiki
Lazing about the beach all day
At night the crickets creepy
Squinting faces at the sky
A Harold Robbins paperback
Surfers drop their boards and dry
And everybody wants a hat

[Chorus]
But behind the chalet
My holiday's complete
And I feel like William Tell
Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet
Pulling mussels from a shell
Pulling mussels from a shell

[Verse 2]
Shrinking in the sea so cold
Topless ladies look away
A he-man in a sudden shower
Shelters from the rain
You wish you had a motor boat
To pose around the harbour bar
And when the sun goes off to bed
You hook it up behind the car


[Chorus]
But behind the chalet
My holiday's complete
And I feel like William Tell
Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet
Pulling mussels from a shell
Pulling mussels from a shell

[Verse 3]
Two fat ladies window shop
Something for the mantelpiece
In for bingo all the nines
A panda for sweet little niece
Coach drivers stand about
Looking at a local map
About the boy, he's gone away
Down to next door's caravan

[Chorus]
But behind the chalet
My holiday's complete
And I feel like William Tell
Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet
Pulling mussels from a shell
Pulling mussels from a shell

The case was pulled from under the bed
She made a call to a sympathetic friend
And made arrangements
The door was closed, there was a note
I couldn't be bothered, maybe I'll choke
No more engagements

[Pre-Chorus 1]
With where-have-you-beens and far away frowns
Trying to be good by not being 'round

[Chorus 1]
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That stupid old bug that kills only love
I want to be good, is that not enough?

[Chorus 2]
So play me the song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart
Then play me the song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart


[Verse 2]
I had excuses, those little boy lies
That she computed by watching my eyes
And told me firmly
She couldn't stand it, I'm bad on her heart
She dropped her make-up and I found the bar
Now it concerns me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I've had a bad time, now love is resigned
I've been such a fool, I've loved and goodbyed

I could see her turning in her bed

There was time to pass but not to spend
Soon I saw that this was silly
Spending all my wages on this peach
When we could sit so very pretty
And get our heads down out on the beach

Falls silent through the lamplight

And up the railway sidings
There's him and her, they're lying
Hand in hand they whisper

The moon was white and virgin
And she was on the turning
Remember your first nibble
When best friends were so little

They really trooped the colours
When walking with each other
And all her mates would giggle
As ladylike she'd wiggle

All along the high street
They'd splash out on an ice cream
He'd sometimes really treat her
But he'd done his mother's meter


Well he went off to Borstal
He said that he was forced to
Rob the flats of Hi Fi's
'Cause she was ill and she would cry

Each morning she got sicker
Her mother sometimes hit her
If she'd have known the story
She would have been so sorry

He received a letter and admitted it
There was nothing else to do but get rid of it
Lonely in his dormitory, he'd sit and stare
Is this is for real and is it really fair?

Down to the coast in his tent
She cooked upon his primus
And sampled local cider

She wouldn't take a hi from me the average man
Funny what money can do to people
But she had a light that had sparked up her evil
Trying to chat up women who rate themselves so high
Shouldn't be my subject but I felt like I should try
Funny what drink can do for soldiers
Well she must into men a little bit older

Funny how it goes -- how money steals the show
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and what's it got for me
Hung over in my tree?
I saw the sun shine bright in front of......

Trying to get her dancing was not an easy job
She made out like Houdini when I said do you bop
Funny what rhythm does it kills me
Like champagne women only seem to spill me
Trying to get the picture, I settled down to a drink
When up came Cinderella, so what was I to think
Funny how these shoes fit a dragon
Well she's like the sharks that you get in Manhattan

A velvet patch upon his eye
His pacing creaks the floorboards loose
As he tailors his thoughts for the truth around truths
But his butler keeps eyes through a hole in the door
What the butler don't see ain't a lot that's for sure
Francesca lays across the couch
They fight with words from mouth to mouth
And then with handfuls of her flesh
See how the zipper broke off of her dress
Strangling her neck with his hands in her gloves
The port and the brandy mix cocktails of love

The porchlight, the torchlight
The frosted morning lawn
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn
On the tale of what the butler saw

He kept his world all to himself
And locked it tight inside his belt
But she preferred his belt undone
She bathed in his fortune but never his fun
He cracked on a mixture of opera and drink
The butler still fetches and carries for him

The butler dragged down to the lake
Francesca's body in a cape
No private eye was gonna trace this
The old man was shaking, his marbles were missed
The shadows and footprints and flickering lights
The butler's up late with a cold in his eye


The porchlight the torchlight the frosted morning lawn

Burp
Damn
LUA nigga

150
Me and the god e good we move swiftly
Nickel bags of funk in my draws
Made 150
Headed out to coney to re
No body with me
Fly nigga got the fly bitches
Fat broads slim Jim hoes
And side biscuits
Cell phone page me
After 9 minutes
Blunted on the bench with the squad
We ride niggas
Slap box and fist fought
Lil wild niggas buyin 40s to sip on
Shouts to the ahks
Soaked game from the movies and the old heads
Crack fienes sings how they use to be coke heads
Tired of being local I'd troop it up town
Hit Harlem
Stroll Brooklyn
And turning up in the Bronx
Bring it back with the crew having chronic fest in the crib
Mom dukes kick us out and shit
""All yall get the fuck out my house""
Back on the corner we go
At least 2 of us would fuck the same neighborhood hoes
And not know
Mont caught the beats in the staircase
Me and Spunk would battle forever like we had beef
And that's my nigga
The neighbor from next door
Hit the studio so we could record getting raped on the cost
We ain't care shit the money was there
Got my 1st gun from ad rock running affairs
Black 45 magnum
Pops snitched on me cause we fought and I ragged him
Mom's said toss the shit or get my ass kicked
Hid it under a closet dresser where all the bags was
That closet was my stash spot
Tried to fuck my ex the bitch was done with me
Faked the funk lovin me fuckin other peeps
Pinto pulls up cherry red is the wheels ride the whole fuckin island smoking and popping pills
The beginning of my madness
Hit Ag  for Bomb head and backshots
She was loving this black cock
Niggas killed murda
Put a pause on my moves
Shit Started Turing bad
The fall apart of my crew
Even cam said damn shit is crazy in the streets blood
We love for the street son but the streets never feeds us
We love for the street son but the street never feeds us
We love for the street son but the streets never feeds us


(Song Transitions to ""The Homie)


The homie
My ace boone coon
Tighter than family
Tradin' off video games
And sharin' candy
Like my Lil brother
Love you mother like she my own
Go back like nappy head fro's with broken combs
We was different from the start, your family had a star and mines was just the fam from the older days of the block
But whatever didn't matter to us cause we was kids
Not a worry in the world the struggle didn't exist
Well at least to us
Runnin' the ghetto with my sneakers scuffed
Hung out on weekends eatin' cereal and pizza crust
Remember when you got me for my sonic 3
Got my ass beat that'll be one of the few last times we speak
Years later in another day and time
We combine like we never lost a dime on the crime side
Guess this is me on the verge of gettin' my mind right
Second chance at life on a timeline
Ya dig

My nigga, my homie
Just like my Lil brotha
Thicker than thieves we lookin' out for each other
But seasons change
And things re arrange
But no matter what you still my nigga and I love ya

2001
Strolling thru the halls of McKee couldn't believe the face I see
It's my nigga my homie
My A1 from day one
My crony
We bout to fuck it up this year sittin' in homeroom
Add you to my circle of misfits
Bugging' havin' fun in the lunchroom trying to bag the bitches
What they see in us, we was wack, just the 3 of us, he Spanish I rap  you tall
That's why they speak to us
You just came and and we was 1 year from headin' out
But still held down no doubt chill at each other house
Dreamcast AOL chats and rap videos
(Ima get a deal and we'll all have fly bitties yo)
Riding' on that train from your crib back to the ghetto where my momma on her job and my father  drunk in the meadow
Looking for that day I get lucky and have it all
Started hangin' in the building with niggas I knew before
Learnin' how to get a dollar in seconds while in the hall
Graduated yea We chillin', but not like we did before
Plus Ray was on his way to the army
I'm working 9 to 5 to be fly and sell some more drugs for profit
Your momma made you get it together and go to college
We divided once again,world turning now what's the options
Years later in another date and time
We combine like we never lost a dime
On the crime side


My nigga, my homie
Just like my Lil brotha
Thicker than thieves we lookin' out for each other
But seasons change
And things re arrange
But no matter what you still my nigga and I love ya

But seasons change

But no matter what you still my nigga and I love ya
My brotha

What up my guy
20-o6 is the timeline
Fucked up but still tryna get up in the limelight
Hit me on my chirp it was on from the bread of dawn
Early morning getting smokers money giving what they want
We was talking bout Linkin' that same day
I say let me make some change and nigga I'm on my way
And then you laughed and thought it was funny
Cause I would be the last nigga you woulda thought was getting money
Train status we posted up in the crib mom dukes wasn't home and shit so we was puffin
Said you knew some niggas I could get dollars we started walking hit the train caught the growl in the stomach cause we was hungry
Said I got you my nigga and imma hold you down
We mobbed deep to the store like we was owning' the ground
D's out on me and caught me with the stash, the cash, The phone and property that I had
Held me down when you took my stuff
But that's when thing between the both of us was up and done
Momma wasn't feeling my gangsta
I was perpetrated as a thug
Cause while mines wasn't home i was out there selling drugs
Caught up in the cripple of the black man's plight
And for that I apologize
On another date and time
We combine like we never lost a dime on the crime side
Guess this is me on the verge of gettin' my mind right

There's a road to the right where the day is all night
And you sleep on the wrong side of bed
And you joke, and you game, and you might change your name
And the things that she’d say have been said

[Chorus]
Going crazy is it really getting late
Crazy, who is left to aggravate
If you go crazy too, you can join the crazy few

[Verse 2]
There’s a house at the top, where believe it or not
There’s a girl who wears nothing but fruit
And the light’s never on ‘cos the ceiling is gone
And the butler, he’s deaf and he's mute

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There’s a girl in my mind and she lives in the pine
By the light of the silvery moon
Where the fiddle does play and the cats are all stray
And so who ran away with the spoon?

[Chorus]

She was frigid like a bible
When she met her boyfriend Michael
He took her in his Zephyr
They sat like salt and pepper
Looking out across the city
From Lover's Leap is pretty
The lights they flick and flutter
He told her how he loved her
Next night he called for her
But dad protected daughter
And told him she was poorly
A lie was told there surely
So Michael felt rejected
This wasn't quite expected
He drove off to his local
Where he felt anti-social

[Verse 2]
She cried all night at missing
The boy she could be kissing
While he was falling over
He drunk himself back sober
And went home in a taxi
And crashed out in the back seat
He slept just like a baby
Which he hadn't done just lately
He saw her in the morning
Out with his sister Pauline
She felt all shy and soppy
He acted cool and cocky
He said tonight at Charlie's
There's going to be a party
I'll meet you at half seven
She visualized the heaven


[Chorus]
If you ever change your mind
Which you do from time to time
Never chew a pickle
With a little slap and tickle
You have to throw the stone
To get the pool to ripple

[Verse 3]
That night they danced together
It looked like love forever
He put his hand on her leg
You should have heard what she said
He tried again much later
It seemed to aggravate her
He drove home in silence
Avoiding all violence
She said let's watch the city
From Lover's Leap is pretty
I think I need the fresh air
She put a comb through her hair
Then while she turned to kiss him
And very nearly missed him
She put her hand on his leg
He felt her tongue in his head

Slightly drunk once again
All alone with my pen
I thought I'd write to you
How can I say how I feel ?
Falling down on a deal
This last night with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is it the cold that makes me shake?
I just hope that I'm awake
I say alright I knew
(I knew)

[Chorus]
I was wrong you were right
(That's a line I cannot find)
I could not say goodbye
(to explain just why I lied)
Why's it always feel the same?
(slightly drunk what you said to me)
I'm in love once again
(can't fall in love without misery)

I'm pretty sad but so what?
I should be glad but I'm not
I'm confused once more
All tangled up in your love
Without it now so that's tough

Out on the road especially
Back to you once more

They do it down on Camber Sands
They do it at Waikiki
Lazing about the beach all day
At night the crickets creepy
Squinting faces at the sky
A Harold Robbins paperback
Surfers drop their boards and dry
And everybody wants a hat

[Chorus]
But behind the chalet
My holiday's complete
And I feel like William Tell
Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet
Pulling mussels from a shell
Pulling mussels from a shell

Shrinking in the sea so cold
Topless ladies look away
A he-man in a sudden shower
Shelters from the rain
You wish you had a motor boat
To pose around the harbour bar
And when the sun goes off to bed
You hook it up behind the car

Something for the mantelpiece
In for bingo all the nines
A panda for sweet little niece
Coach drivers stand about
Looking at a local map
About the boy, he's gone away
Down to next door's caravan

She made a call to a sympathetic friend
And made arrangements
The door was closed, there was a note
I couldn't be bothered, maybe I'll choke
No more engagements

The Indians send signals from the rocks above the pass
The cowboys take position in the bushes and the grass
The squaw is with the corporal, she is tied against the tree
She doesn't mind the language, it's the beating she don't need
She lets loose all the horses when the corporal is asleep
And he wakes to find the fire's dead and arrows in his hats
And Davy Crockett rides around and says it's cool for cats
It's cool for cats

[Chorus]
Cool for cats

[Verse 2]
The Sweeney's doing ninety 'cause they've got the word to go
They get a gang of villains in a shed up at Heathrow
They're counting out the fivers when the handcuffs lock again
In and out of Wandsworth with the numbers on their names
It's funny how their missus' always look the bleeding same
And meanwhile at the station there's a couple of likely lads
Who swear like, ""How's your father?"" and they're very cool for cats
They're cool for cats

[Chorus]
Cool for cats


[Verse 3]
To change the mood a little I've been posing down the pub
On seeing my reflection, I'm looking slightly rough
I fancy this, I fancy that, I wanna be so flash
I give a little muscle and I spend a little cash
But all I get is bitter and a nasty little rash
And by the time I'm sober, I've forgotten what I've had
And everybody tells me that it's cool to be a cat
Cool for cats

[Chorus]
Cool for cats

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Shape up at the disco and I think I've got a pull
I ask her lots of questions as she hangs on to the wall
I kiss her for the first time and then I take her home
I'm invited in for coffee and I'll give the dog a bone
She likes to go to discos, but she's never on her own
I said, ""I'll see you later"", and give her some old chat
But it's not like that on the TV when it's cool for cats
It's cool for ca-a-a-ats

I met her in a bar room
Her name I didn't catch
She looked like something special
The kind who'd understand
The room was almost spinning
She pulled another smile
She had the grace-like pleasure
She had a certain style

[Chorus]
Sunlight on the lino
Woke me with a shake
I looked around to find her
But she'd gone
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

[Verse 2]
She took me to her motel
A room on the second floor
A kettle and two coffees
A number on the door
She said I hardly know you
Agreed we kissed goodnight
I knew that in the morning
Somehow I'd wake to find


[Chorus]
Sunlight on the lino
Waking me with a shake
I looked around to find her
But she'd gone
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

[Verse 3]
I've lost my silver Bracelet
My club room locker keys
The money in the billfold
It doesn't bother me
My wife has moved to Boston
So Mug is not the word
If you ever see her
Say hello goodbye girl

Woke me with a shake

I never thought it would happen
With me and the girl from Clapham
Out on a windy common
That night I ain't forgotten
When she dealt out the rations
With some or other passions
I said, ""You are a lady""
""Perhaps,"" she said, ""I may be""

[Verse 2]
We moved into a basement
With thoughts of our engagement
We stayed in by the telly
Although the room was smelly
We spent our time just kissing
The Railway Arms we're missing
But love had got us hooked up
And all our time it took up

[Verse 3]
I got a job with Stanley
He said I'd come in handy
And started me on Monday
So I had a bath on Sunday
I worked eleven hours
And bought the girl some flowers
She said she'd seen a doctor
And nothing now could stop her


[Bridge]
I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better
And when the time was ready
We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
With little kicks inside her

[Verse 4]
This morning at 4:50
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another

[Verse 5]
And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier
She left me when my drinking
Became a proper stinging
The devil came and took me
From bar to street to bookie
No more nights by the telly
No more nights nappies smelly


[Verse 6]
Alone here in the kitchen
I feel there's something missing
I'd beg for some forgiveness
But begging's not my business
And she won't write a letter
Although I always tell her
And so it's my assumption

There's a road to the right where the day is all night
And you sleep on the wrong side of bed
And you joke, and you game, and you might change your name
And the things that she’d say have been said

[Chorus]
Going crazy is it really getting late
Crazy, who is left to aggravate
If you go crazy too, you can join the crazy few

[Verse 2]
There’s a house at the top, where believe it or not
There’s a girl who wears nothing but fruit
And the light’s never on ‘cos the ceiling is gone
And the butler, he’s deaf and he's mute

[Chorus]

There’s a girl in my mind and she lives in the pine
By the light of the silvery moon
Where the fiddle does play and the cats are all stray
And so who ran away with the spoon?

On that midnight shopping trip that Christmas Eve
We'd lie on your bed and talk for hours

Of little girls that learn to justify

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use

There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes


They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

I just woke up, woke up, woke up, up
I just woke up, woke up, woke up, up
I just woke up, woke up, woke up, up
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to bе someone elsе

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away


[Verse 2]
When no one's around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use

There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes


They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me",en,"Back through the years I go wondering once again Back to the seasons of my youth I recall a box of rags that someone gave us And how my mamma put these rags to use There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colours that mamma made for me Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see That one is only poor only if they choose to be Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me",0.9946790933609008,2008.0,8.0,25.0

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use

There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes


They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Girl what's it gon' take to have you close to me
Right by my side where you supposed to be
They start to notice you when they notice me
And you can have it all free of charge
I know you like European cars
Take, take a look at my garage
Maybe we can all ménage
Me in the middle and your legs to the stars

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got that Bentley, that Ferrari, that Lambo lean
My car game crazy, I can't be seen
That Aston, Bugatti, the Range and the Rolls
Got me freakin off with some high class hoes
You know with me man anything goes
I'll have shorty in the telly workin all 3 holes
Jesus, I betcha won't believe this
Unless I letcha see this, she deep throat my whole car
Now I'm thinkin' this bitch is so hot
I gotta take her to my hood, let her blow my whole block
Yeah I just happen to be what she like
She say I'm special, I'm like, ""Yeah babe you're right""
A lil Goose, a lil Patron tonight
I'll have the club lookin like a fuckin Zoo aight
New music, you can't confuse it
With the other cliques or groups, its the Unit

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, shorty came over, I told her, I can mold her
Turn her, to a rider, rollin, with a roller
Hold her, like a cobra, bone her, til she sober
Fold her, in positions til its hard to bend over
I'm a very special kind, I can't let you shine
These rappers out they mind, don't compare to me combined
If you look at my design, my Louie fittin' fine
My jewelry might blind, I'ma walkin' white line
You can't get on my level, that'll take a lifetime
And I got it at 25, take your lifetime
I don't care about crime as long as its not mine
I'ma be fine, I'm stronger than white lines
If your girl ain't home, 'til the early morn
She's prolly with the G-Unit gettin' it on
I told her she's Miss Right, so I can't be wrong
And we went at it all night long

Now how did the chicken give birth to a rat?
Now how did the rat learn to sing like a bird?
His pops is a O.G., this is absurd
My gun game right, my knife game right
Fuck around I'll get right, in broad daylight
Spin the barrel on a nigga, pin the tail on the donkey
It's a zoo out this bitch, I put a hole in the monkey
Got the Gemstars to rip 'em, hundred shots to clip 'em
Body bags they zip 'em, and we don't know a thang

Strapped like Commando, B-A-N-K-dollar sign

Switch overnight I can't, I'm outside his camp
I'm 'bout a dollar boy and dollar bills'll kill
Kill that bullshit, I'm famous but I'm ridin' with the steel
Will throw it all away, I see you later today
You'll see 'em fadin' away, that's all I'm able to say

Nigga you so tough
Tough until your heartbeat stop

You bleed into shock, get in the pine box
Damn you's a hard motherfucker
You're so tough
Tough until your punk ass hit
The four-fifth kick, the Heckler spit
You in deep shit, oh now your ass sick
You supposed to be hard motherfucker
You're so tough

Bury all your hatin', 'cause hatred will bury ya
Learn not to talk tough talk through your cellular
Fucked then beef, the president and senator
There is no peace, you're the prey or the predator
While you plottin' on me, I'm 10 steps ahead of ya
Black 40 caliber I put a infrared on ya
Nigga I'm special, you mad 'cause ya regular
Man I don't want your bitch, I damn near remember her
Refresh my memory, oh yeah I slept with her
No wonder she ain't mention you when I met with her
Mind on my cheddar, they'll remember me forever
The groundwork I put in made my lifestyle better..and better
I like the fuckin' street, bright in the phantom lights
Montana light, two women, in my hand is ice (woo!)
They ran a plane twice
But I don’t forget where I come from
Dumb dumb, nigga every night

Gangstas they never hide, thank God I'm still alive

My waist look like I got the MAC on me
These hoes on my dick, I got that ass on me
You an RN, regular nigga that rap homie
I’m crack homie, I’m dope money
I wake up and wipe my ass with coke money

I came to get somethin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin'
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin'
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em
I never liked these niggas anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a building today
Hey.. Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin' I ain't smirkin', I ain't muh'fuckin' jokin'
See if you think somethin sweet when your head open
Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy-ass crib on a stake-out
With a pound, two clips, and Chinese take-out
You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me, spray me

If I fall off, I rebound quick
Like Greg Oden, Tony Yay' I be holdin
German mouths on my hip, cause my wrist be frozen
How these rappers claim Blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim Cuz and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm, then jump in Optimus Prime
Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bullet-proof Ac', who you stylin on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward-ass niggas bring your jewelry out

Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggas on game shows, two dudes kissin'
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame

This is the Unit
The mighty mighty mighty Unit
This is how we do it
Ayy (ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I made the A lean and pop to it, N.Y. pop to it
No frontin here shorty, niggas know how I do it
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot
Find me trippin, ridin slow through the back blocks
Red Coupe switchin lanes, top down, party frame
Diamond rings, diamond chains, diamonds on e'rythang
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip
Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God
Party ain't never over, niggas hardly ever sober
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Bitches recognize when I'm walkin' in
Smokin' that piff, goin' where dolphins swim
44-Colt, that's tossin' him
And that four-do' Porsche what I'm flossin' in (YEAH!)
I'm in the black, you in the red
You owe your label money, I'm gettin bread
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin' can save ya
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!)
Bitch play cute, I don't get upset
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin set
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal
Hoes was like, ""He's all right, but he's not ill!""


[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You might see me yawnin', four in the mornin'
But the party ain't over
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it
The party ain't over
Shorty move like you wanna move, work it shorty
Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me
Now get low, shorty work that back
Now get low, yeah just like that
Now get low

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, they love it when I pop round, doors up, top down
Seat back, keep that, motherfuckin' Glock round
Nigga this is my town, my block, my crown
My sound, peace to my niggas on lockdown
They don't really want that, they know we get it poppin'
Six-four droppin', you still window shoppin'
I'm ridin' round rockin', knockin', Rakim
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains
I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga
I toast wit'cha - if ya got a cup
Hold your fuckin' bottle up, I really want a model but
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut
I'm just playin', unless you gon' do it
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it
Ain't nobody bleedin', I guess it's all music


[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Shawty the kush still burnin', Aston Martin wheel turnin'
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German
Bottles is still poppin', clubs is still rockin'
Feds is still watchin', but fiends is still shoppin'
I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal
How would you feel if you niggas just got 400 mil' (Like me)
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang
She let me have her brain, I let her wear my chain
I'm on the plane smokin' on that Mary Jane
Listenin' to Trina while she run game on Lil Wayne (Stupid)
My Ten-a-Key timepiece shinin' like a light bulb
David Brown t-shirt, dressed just like a thug

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You might see me yawnin', four in the mornin'
But the party ain't over
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, yeah, uhh, G-G-G-G you know!
Uhh.. the game took a turn crazy, it's all gravy
Thanks to 50 Cent and Shady, they gon' play me
These lil' niggas can't fade me, they just babies
Play me I'm arm crazy, I'm Tom Brady
Emeralds and baguettes when I'm hoppin' up off the jet
A nigga reach for that and I'm choppin' him in his neck
One big remix, and she'll be on my penis
If my flow had a phoenix and my paws are the cleanest
9-millimeters in the bars and arenas
If you hood then you seen us, with wood in the Beamers
I'm that new nigga, they all over Adidas
When they see us they don't charge that shit, they wanna be us
(LET, IT, GO!)


[Interlude: Mavado]
When we pressed to go, body restin' up
They wan' mop up all that blood, but he's testin' us
The moon eclipse, is a mess and ah
We'll compose the new and then test it oh (LET, GO!)

Feds ran in the crib, squad all in my yard
I'm the high school dropout, crack game genius
The MAC'll turn your back into ""Kill Bill"" arenas
I'm - criminal minded - you've been blinded
Feds lookin for my bricks but can't find it
Maneuver with the Ruger, the grip is rubber
My Frank Mueller, is dipped in them rainbow colors
Bein broke is a disease, I need that guap and that cheddar
I learned that, in the Maybach, with Fif' and Mayweather
Mix the milk with Amaretta, my Beretta's in my leather
My tiger striped eagle make your people need weather (LET, IT, GO!)

I don't wan' talk about it (50)
Man I don't wanna talk about it (nah)
Man I don't wan' talk about it (yeah)
And I don't wanna talk about it (wooo-oooh!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
These niggas police
Go 'head, ask me what I'm ridin' in so I can say the Enzo
My bitch roll down the window so I could feel the wind blow
Got big enough for me to fiddle on my kinfolk
Bitches with me cruisin', Moulin Rouge and
They fuckin' and they strippin' nigga, I ain't even trippin' nigga
Me I handle business; God's my only witness
Watchin' homicide, sayin' ""Who the fuck did this?""
Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne
Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne
I don't fuck around boy; you better ask around boy
I hit you with the pound, leave yo' ass on the ground
For, you poppin' that bullshit, like I don't pull shit
Fully loaded clips and whips, get the grip, clip the bricks
Nigga we hittin' licks, stickin' shit, gettin' rich
That's why my name ring bells all around this bitch
Any hood you go through they know 50 Cent (wooo-oooh!)
And I don't wanna talk about it (OHH!)


[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it

Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, it's the kid nigga, yeah
Ayo, big money, my car got the big face (yeah!)
Forty-five, my belt got the big eights
Niggas hate but I'm low seven star Caesar
For grimy niggas tryin to line me like {?} preacher
You niggas got the nerve, I'm at Johannesburg
With Mandela nephew blowin' heavy herb
Then back to the projects, low from the task force
The dope spot's sellin' more shit than Scott Storch
I'm tired of these pricks, lyin' 'bout bricks
Got my can and my white, my tan like Mariah and Nick
Fly in the '60 U.F.O
Unidentified flyin object on twenty-fo's
More money more hoes, more money more clothes
Smoke that AK-48, not bullshit 'dro (yeah)
I rock big arenas, not bullshit shows
And my pants three thousand, these ain't bullshit clothes (OHH!)


[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it

Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Nah, uhh
B-A, N-K, S-5, 5-oh
Or 6-8, M-G, tinted with my eyes low
Homie I'm a Tahoe, fully loaded nine blow
You see out on hydro, Luciano blind ho
Louie V offended me, yo' bitch in my Bentley C
And weekends are the chills, I'ma fuck her 'til she empty
Empty on you if you front, 'til your passenger is stuck
Give your ass a brand new scar, in need of a brand new car
I ain't them I'm different baby, I talk, you listen baby
Listen and I'll show you, how money controls you
I'll put you in my old school, and let you pop the switch
Pocketful in every packet, that's why I'm poppin' shit
I don't forgive I don't forget, what you said, where you flip
When you get hit, I hope that's it, pop-pop, all on your whip
I-I, be on that shit, I'm high, I'm on that piff
Bye-bye, you fuckin' bitch, you ain't hot, you ain't rich
You a snitch!


[Chorus: 50 Cent]

My rope all freezy, dope on the TV
Ecstasy especially out the GT
You next to me, you best to be holdin' somethin' too
Least you can say, you let somethin' fly when somethin' flew
These niggas get hit and call they lawyer
And try to sue you, that's a bitch nigga for ya
I'm tough like Mayoga, and De La Hoya, I saw ya
Man niggas'll stack nines for that Cola
'Cause zips in my shit, I don't grow stems
Him got 14 karats, carrots, and gold rims
Why say somethin' about my name?
Don't jump out the window, it's safer jumpin' out a plane
I can't ditch my bitch, it's somethin' 'bout her brain
If she put her mind to it, she could suck out a vein
You don't want a lead shower stay the fuck out the rain
There's so much ammo niggas don't gotta aim

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
You don't get a warnin', there's no heads up when it's on
Here it comes, ready or not
Don't be out there snorin', one eye blink and you're gone
Keep it cocked - and ready to pop
The man makes no mistakes, it's been on since the date I was born
Stop drop, or get lead in your knot
I'm known in hip-hop, but I'm still ridin' around with my chrome
Here it comes - ready or not


[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, yeah
My little shooter's 16 from the projects
Glock-16 with the Napoleon complex
I'm in and out the projects, my lifestyle pleasant
You? You live life like a barbaric peasant
Me without my gun in the streets is like a Muslim eatin' pig feet
Fuck the pigs on the street
They all wanna off a nigga - and when these rappers
Get shot they ain't gangsta, they turn into corporate niggas
You die if it's rated R
If it's PG-13 you leave with a scar
R.I.P. to Troy and Bags, big shout to Hommo
They got fishin' money cooked, buy me the Apollo
These model hoes swallow, I buy another bottle
Of this M.O.B. nigga, that's my motto
These rappers ain't kings, they pawns
And got dust bunnies on they guns

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
You don't get a warnin', there's no heads up when it's on
Here it comes, ready or not
Don't be out there snorin', one eye blink and you're gone

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I think God spent a lil' extra time on me
Pop planted a miracle seed my mom ain't see
I got a high intelligence level, I ain't no dummy
I ain't satisfied with 10 mil', that ain't no money
My talents are blood deep, you can't take those from me
And my sense of humor's shot, I don't take jokes funny
My paranoia rolls with my bullet holes
Givin' me a third eye, my foes can get a magazine full of those
The hip-hop cops follow my Suburban
Hopin' they can find a pistol on him when they search him
I'm icier in person, they like me when I'm cursin'
So here's a dirty version, you only heard me urban
If niggas try to hurt him, the I-30's squirtin'
Right through your curtain, don't stop 'til you murk him
Mechanical workin', Heckler handle's jerkin'
That'll pull the Gate in after you Heavenly church him

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
You don't get a warnin', there's no heads up when it's on
Here it comes, ready or not
Don't be out there snorin', one eye blink and you're gone

Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round

L.A., money make the world go round
Midwest, money make the world go round
Down South, money make the world go round
Southside, money make the world go round

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Some people want nothin' out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin' life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah, a nigga rich but I'm livin' like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin' alive was no jive
Standin' on the strip you get stuck like Velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)


[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, money make the world go round and I got her
Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill
Kill for bread, anyone will from Queens to Gun Hill
I'm one man, but I own more than one steel
Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Mink Gucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's .380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess
Police stompin' niggas by the twenty
And shootin' by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny
Matter fact, man I'ma do anything for the dough
NY's finest with llamas and Mo'

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I love that money, I need that money
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggas goners, you rule all the corners
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the mourners, mourners

Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it

Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But do you think that it's your destiny to get the best of me, but I suggest you be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, 'cause I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette, and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know how, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
I got know how
Party people
I got know how
I kick it just like this

[Verse 2]
I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, 'cause I'm that type of man
'Cause I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
'Cause when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it 'cause I got know how, you know what I'm sayin'?


[Chorus]
I got know how
Party people
I got know how
Bust it

[Verse 3]
MCs I'll ruin, 'cause I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like Doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavor's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice till the break of dawn
'Cause I'm tough like a bone, Sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from an architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face and then you hear my sound
Comin' at you with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
'Cause I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know how, you know what I'm sayin'?

Got up early, found something's missing
My only name
No one else sees but I got stuck
And soon forever came
Stopped pushing on for just a second
Then nothing's changed
Who am I this time where's my name?
Guess it crept away

[Chorus]
No one's calling for me at the door
An unpredictable, won't bother anymore
And silently gets harder to ignore
Look straight ahead
There's nothing left to see
What's done is done
This life has got its hold on me
Just let it go
What now can never be

[Post-Chorus]
I forgot that I might see
So many beautiful things
I forgot that I might need
To find out what life could bring
Beautiful things


[Verse 2]
Take this happy ending away
It's all the same
God won't waste this simplicity
On possibility
Get me up, wake me up
Dreams are filling this trace of blame
Frozen still, I thought I could stop
Now who's gonna wait?

[Chorus]
No one's calling for me at the door
An unpredictable, won't bother anymore
And silently gets harder to ignore
Look straight ahead
There's nothing left to see

Just let it go
What now can never be

Left behind my inventions
A talent for my own destruction
Is all I've ever owned
And in the dark a fog descends
The velvet edges split and then
The bright lights have found me again
Alone with a microphone
(So I sang)
These are the happiest days of my life, I know
Black anoraks, synthesized strings
Two tarnished tin wedding rings
Nostalgia for meaningful things is all I've ever known
These are the happiest days of my life, I know
My death scene played to no applause
Two angels came to my dire cause
Their voices like melodic
As they spoke to me and said
""Your darkness is brighter than
All the lights in the disco tonight
Your darkness is brighter, you are inevitable
Then why is she making me wait so long?""",en,"I ran from the haunted mansion Left behind my inventions A talent for my own destruction Is all I've ever owned And in the dark a fog descends The velvet edges split and then The bright lights have found me again Alone with a microphone (So I sang) These are the happiest days of my life, I know Black anoraks, synthesized strings Two tarnished tin wedding rings Nostalgia for meaningful things is all I've ever known These are the happiest days of my life, I know My death scene played to no applause Two angels came to my dire cause Their voices like melodic As they spoke to me and said ""Your darkness is brighter than All the lights in the disco tonight Your darkness is brighter, you are inevitable Then why is she making me wait so long?""",-0.957445502281189,2008.0,8.0,11.0

You don't look in my eyes when you're talking to me
She said, ""Do you think I'm some kind of fool?""
My fixed gaze wouldn't let me give a response
So I just sat there drinking my stuff!

My head became a whirlwind of confusion
But I was calm, I was disillusioned!
There couldn't be no way I might escape

Because the world ain't a very pretty place!

And all the madness, clenching my fists!

Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis

My guilt and my shame
Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

[Verse 2]
So let me get this straight
The only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it, untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it or die

[Chorus]
Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur


[Verse 3]
My life is undone
And I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue
I'm probably wrong but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had

Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again, I can't go back again
But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive

[Chorus]
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

[Verse 2]
You told me to love you and I did
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
So when I got away, I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong


[Pre-Chorus]
We were never alive
And we won't be born again

I know my uses, I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learn my lessons, I've conquered death
I go on, and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Another fuckin' accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange
In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's every day

[Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same
In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything

“It wouldn’t be a Slipknot album if there wasn’t an anti-pop song.”[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Contrite, commercial
Arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker
Mindless, like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened, no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
I don't want you anymore (I don't want you anymore)
I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
Fingerprint of God
Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever
You'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

You'll never censor me
You better cherish me
My reason has a voice
Freedom's gone but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense
It doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you
Fuck you all, I'm the only point of view

[Guitar Solo: Jim Root]

[Break: Corey Taylor]
Oh, violence and dollar signs
Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds
And give away the only

Lost, don't understand the incredible path

Do you believe?
Do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe, let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes
Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

[Verse 2]
The blood and the body control the cut, so it's seamless
Show me your heart, show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene, I treasure, can you help me?
I sever, God, it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now, I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)

Welcome home

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor, Clown & Chris Fehn]
Mother nature is a coward (Mother nature is a whore)
No more presence, no more power (I pray for death, by the hour)
Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are)
My artifice won't recognize me (You won't find me anymore)
Post-traumatic war machines
The pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes
It's all I came to feel
Let my weapons be your children
Let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence
Try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own (Every right to kill my own)

My anguish conquers all
Pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken
My broken key is only me

Thou shalt not

[Verse 1]
Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fucking anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear

[Verse 2]
Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fucking everything
But we're alive, and we're not accepting anything

The answer is clear
Annihilation

Things I do not understand

Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever, well I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fucking anything
But my solace is I can handle everything

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?

The state of the nation – violation
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
And we will burn 'cause we won't unite
What are we conceding for our freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em?
I would rather fight than let another die
We're the problem, but we're also the solution
All hope is gone
If you want it, come and take it from me
If you think you can, you still don't know me
Let me tell you, man, if I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it
Fifty seconds, a hundred murders
The bill of rights is a bill of sale
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails?

[Chorus: Corey Taylor, Corey Taylor, Clown, Chris Fehn & Paul Gray]
We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starve to death
In a place where no one goes
The air itself is a final breath
So discontinue the antiseptic care charade
As a cry of justice comes, a malignant fire fades
I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the remedy, spit in my face
All your laws and rules are outdated
All your subjects are killing the kings
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

Child of burning time
Child of burning time

[Verse 1]
My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter hasn't ended, and it always looks like rain
I can't remember anything, anything
Inside the absolution, we succumb
And appetites are bittersweet, I think I'm going numb
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time is gone, he hasn't come back yet

[Verse 2]
Before I tell my story, please, consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go away
My skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame

[Pre-Chorus]
I cut my name into my heart
I'll tear it all apart

[Chorus]
I beg you, burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today


[Post-Chorus]
I'll burn away
I'll burn away
I'll burn away
I'll burn away

[Verse 3]
My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over, I won't ever lose my rage

[Pre-Chorus]
I cut my name into my soul
I guess I'll never know

[Chorus]
I beg you, burn me away

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

[Verse 2]
She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable

She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do

My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets
And charity laced with a lie
And still, we keep hoping to fix all the defects
And strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together, for better or worse
Our history is too real to hate
Now and forever, we stay until morning
And promise to fight for our fate

[Chorus]
'Til we die, 'til we die

[Verse 2]
The start of the journey is every bit worth it
I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid
And the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped to trying, I've never stopped to feeling
Like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent
Compliments each and every one

'Til we die, 'til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
'Til we die, 'til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes
I've never known trust like The Nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed
They'll never ever take us alive

You know, always been a starter yung'un don't do beach
Home grind derby, I'm headed for the feets
But instead of niggas standin up and cheer for me
Wanna see my momma cry, homies pour beer for me
I mean, once again I'm a product what you made me
Solid as a Roc I couldn't sign with Jay-Z
See first Infrared, and then Bloodline
Now I'm a young boss and shorty it's grill time
Back tatted for my niggas cause I love mine
And now this real talk, is no punchline
Yeah, and I ain't speakin no riddles
My bro had squares with stamps in the middle
He used to take trips they would pack up the rental
Pop was at the crib, still workin on a demo
Yung livin reckless, blowin on chronic
Momma sent me off to school, said her son was demonic
Secluded from the world, I couldn't see trees
But it gave me time to grow a little, time to do me
Writin raps in my head no beat
Fucked up bed, one pillow, no sheet
And my pops wrote a letter in about a month it reads

Bro, what's poppin'?

It's 'bout time, real Chi-Town niggas link up

Without no further a due

I give you Yung Berg and Twista, let's get it in

Where do we go from here?

Now that all of the children are grown up

And I will respond my time

Knowing nobody gives us a hand

Aye

(Aye)

If y'all niggas don't get ya money right

This time you know what sayin'


I'm giving niggas till the end of 07 'bout 08

(Where we going?)

My bank account gon' have eight digits that is

Let's go

(Let's go)



Verse 1:

Nobody gave me nothing

I made 50 of a pack

When I made 100

I ran straight to the block

Bounced back with the work like

(Take it all, you need me)


Yes, sir

Niggas better get wit the program

I'm fast on a track

But I kill a slow jam

Oh man, goddamn

Brand new chain is straight from Hussein

Mo shoes, mo cars

(Take it all, you need me)

Mo clothes, mo brain, oh yeah

Never rolled around in a drop top V

Like me, like we, YB, that's us

Too fast, too hard

(Take it all, you need me)

Young Buck, catch up, yep

I'mma prime time player

Shorty, don't smoke weed

She a high time hater and

Why date her hand, my paper is

(Take it all, you need me)

Few taller than a skyscraper

Niggas better know how to ride the 101

Big shotgun and I buy another one and another

(And another)

And another

(And another)

(Take it all, you need me)

Keep going, is you wit it?

You ain't got shit to say less you did it

You ain't never came from nothin' and blew wit it

(But)

Who did it?

(Yep)

Hook:

Where do we go from here?

Verse 2 (Twista):

Now, now, I'm a old G in the city and ya knew one day

A nigga was gon' come along and spit that real shit

Wanna bet, what?

(Take it all, you need me)

That he too much of a thug for you

Wanna be ballers out here to deal with

Make it competition, go sit on the couch for him

If he need work I'mma hand it out for him

If he need a pistol I'mma hand it out for him

(Take it all, you need me)

Yung Berg and the Twista and I'll vouch for him, that's me

Could spit it just so I could spit it

Flow a just so could flow a, fuck her like I could fuck her

(Take it all, you need me)

Do her like I could do her, get it how you got to get it

Me and my boy came up on tha block

Hustling by the building

Just stacking the money up to the ceiling

Ain't no penicillin finna hit 'em

When I'm dealing wit 'em ask Yung Berg

Where we go after we kill 'em?

'Cuz we gettin' money and the roof gon' be so wicked

Is the reason we can kick it how we kick

And it's the reason why we pull up on the 30's

(Take it all, you need me)

And the Hummers and we don't give a fuck

If we get a ticket and

Why I pay a hundred dollars for a watch?

Five fifty for a ounce a kush, three fifty for a pair of jeans

And thirty thousand for a Charger

(Take it all, you need me)

Two hundred for all cops on the first look

Got money on the books

And we got the dollars for Impalers

And the Thumpers and the Hummers

And I'm throwing out the other figgas

Yung B E R to the G wit the TB some killas

And we never taking shit from off another nigga

Every time I had mo of to dank

Niggas think I be finish

But I got mo in the tank

I'mma take a chunk of ya chip

And then go to the bank so, uh

Yes sir, niggas said Dr Wine wasn't nothing

That's right I'mma a prince of the Chi-Town

So where my south side niggas at right now

So she rock with me, and I roll wit her
Cause I'm a d-boy, and she's a go getter
Uhh, this new girl that I'm provin on
Got a young boy thinkin 'bout movin on
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and her shoes on
Wanna take her to the telly bust a move dawg

The boss boy gotta roll with the flyest bitch
And she the truth; if I'm lyin' then I'm dyin' man

See first Infrared, and then Bloodline
Now I'm a young boss and shorty it's grill time
Back tatted for my niggas cause I love mine
And now this real talk, is no punchline
Yeah, and I ain't speakin no riddles

Pop was at the crib, still workin on a demo

Secluded from the world, I couldn't see trees
But it gave me time to grow a little, time to do me

Fucked up bed, one pillow, no sheet

To the gods in the sky, there's one thing you can do
You can send us some sun and we'll play you this tune
Because sitting in our room, lying down with a scoob
And the sunshine through our window

[Chorus]
Oh, it's days like these that'll make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky with a Lassie
Or hassle-free hours passing by with that beat (One, two)
Singing, ""Days like these"", kicking back
Just doing what we do

[Refrain]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Number one, I wanna find some loving in the sun
With someone that can make me growl and hum
Say, ""Hmmm..."", a boom, a boom shak
And the beat that she throw at me, knocking me flat
Number two, I'd cruise where the grass is smooth
And the sound of the sea is a dreamy melody
Snooze all afternoon
'Til the night time wake me, 'cause shakedown soon
Number three, I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
I find sweet simplicity by kissing my honey
Get funky like Bond when he's played by Connery
And crafty like Don Corleone
Four, watching Oliver jam a little more
Remember the night when I saw
What I never, never, never seen before
Lavender wrestling a rich, wild boar


[Refrain]
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Whack, beats splat, wake up on the attack
Work myself frantic to the moon and back
Now it's evening and the sausages are frying out back
I write my rhyme for this track, as the skies fade to black
Now I remember earlier in the day
As I was swimming through the bay
A bass player I know swum my way
He said, ""G'day, hey, you wanna go see some reggae?
Starts at eight, and plays through to sunrise the next day""
So 9 o'clock sees me heading out towards the tabernacle
Hardcore reggae beat bring me feet out of these shackles
Hardcore reggae DJ, I salute you, crackle, crackle, crackle
Crackle of the vinyl, now I'm high, now a spectacular night ahead
I met a Mexican called Juan
(There's a party on the hill, would you like to come?)
Yeah (And bring a bottle of rum)
Can't afford it, but I bought it


[Verse 3]
And then I sung
It's nights like these when you know that you're alive
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
Nights like these when you don't have to try
Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And my eyes want to cry 'cause the night and the sky
Is so high and my life is sublime and it's mine and it's time
(It's now time)
Oh, it's nights like these when you know that you're alive
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry
Nights like these when I'm drowning in your eyes
(I feel like I've been living)
Nights like these when you know that you're alive
(My life from the beginning)
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
(And all the songs I'm singing)
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry
(Is all the love I'm giving)

They make the music that we play sound oh, so sweet
And my mother always made me eat broccoli

An ace up my sleeve and a slinky plan B

A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confession now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through

Now there's nothing you can do

We've been waitin' on the front line
We've been prepared our entire lives for this day to arrive
And no doubt this will be part of our history
We're making our move, and we're breaking out of the grind

[Pre-Chorus]
Today, the new age
We'll rise up, state our case
Throw it down

And after the rain
The only ones that still remain are standing proud
Separated from the crowd

[Chorus 1]
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Turn on the light
(How do we know? How do we know?)
I need to decide
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Because we may not
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Survive tonight

(How do we know? How do we know?)
But I'll take my chance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Spare me the romance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
And we'll give it all
(How do we know? How do we know?)
That we can


[Verse 2]
New information comin' down the line
But as far as I can tell, it's just the blind leading the blind
I've seen frustration written in the eyes
Of a disaffected race being born and robbed of their time

[Pre-Chorus]
Today, the new age
We'll rise up, state our case
Throw it down

And after the rain
The only ones that still remain are standing proud
Separated from the crowd

Give me shelter from the storm

Considering how recent
I've piled the dirt on your name

Are you listening? (Are you listening?)

Will give way to summer's warmth
Oh no, like salt in the snow
I'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road

Is this where I am for your sake
Stuck between sleep and awake?
My mind is dreaming of things
Are you listening?
I took you for granted again
And threw you aside and pretended for one minute
That I had control of my life
And direction it seemed to be in

It's like I never had time to look away;
Bodies stuck between death and decay
Are plastic and set up on display
And their eyes are wide and they are looking my way
Each ligament exposed each muscle connected
And every organ that I proudly neglected
Have been arranged for the common collective
Stomaching the sight of human flesh resurrected

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems we're fearfully made and designed
But it's a shame we can so blind

[Chorus]
We're all the same
Made of hair and bones and water and blood cells
And we're all to blame
For spending way too much time on ourselves

[Verse 2]
I have been blessed and now I'm blind
The veil's been pulled over my eyes
Now every bad season that kept me believing seems so contrived
There's more glory to be seen and savored through suffering
Than ever was through self serving escape


[Pre-Chorus]
It seems we're fearfully made and designed
But it's a shame we can so blind

Sick with regret, you sputter out
Your flame swallowed in doubt
Light the cigarette and take a breath
The smoke inflates your chest and thins your blood
So you bleed less inside

On foreign shores you fight or die

And leaves it's toll on your calloused empty soul

What great risk to truly live
We could die alone

In my dreamlike state I'll pretend I'm unscathed
But when I wake up my resilience fades
When I wake up my resilience fades

I left my heart in a plastic box
On the bedside table
It will be locked
'Til I get home

Tired of constantly missing my girl
And I long to smell the sea
I long to smell the sea
The sea, the sea
The sea, the sea
The sea, yeah

[Verse 2]
I miss the Pacific Ocean and the northwestern air
And to run each of my fingers through the strands of her hair
I've been all over this country lately
But I've been nowhere it seems, nowhere
I've found the cure for my landlocked blues
It's coming home to you
It's coming home to you
You, oh oh oh
You, oh oh oh
You, oh oh oh
You oh


[Bridge]
If a simple seed gets just what it needs
Then a redwood tree can grow
Up to a hundred feet for the world to see
And endure the sleet and the snow
But if my whole life was wrapped and priced
I wonder what the tag would show
'Cause every time I'm close to the holy ghost
I always seem to let her go

I touted my proudest thoughts, unabashedly uncool
I sang a song of snot and played myself for a fool
Cracked my chest to let my heart's vast ignorance shine through
Regaled all my dreamy brain farts as if they'd already come true

[Verse 2]
I scattered the straightest thoughts
Shouted the sweetest tunes
I footed the stiffest costs
And suffered the stupidest wounds

[Verse 3]
While practicing the pratfall from my hubris hot air balloon
The rushing of endorphins made me forget it wasn't true

[Chorus]
The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone
You had to be there
I guess you just had to be there

[Verse 4]
I met a sweet young woman whose heart I longed to woo
She shattered my perceptions with a snap, and off they flew


[Verse 5]
My love was so enormous
It obscured the world from view
And I was sure it was all over
When she said she loved me too

[Verse 6]
But I fell back on old habits before I realized I knew
And in the course of making fun of it, I forgot my love was true

[Chorus]
The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone
You had to be there
I guess you had to be there, oh-oh

[Verse 7]
The difficulty of this maneuver
Is moot over the telephone
You had to be there
I guess you just had to be there

[Verse 8]
And I want you all to know
I'm not ashamed of it, not a bit
And I'll not apologize
Not in the middle of a game you can only win by
Believing your own bullshit
'Cause I'm on the warpath to unintentional humor
I'm on the expressway to irrelevance


[Verse 9]
Unintentional humor--have I achieved it at last?
Unintentional humor--is it a thing of the past?
Unintentional humor--so shallow, so vast
Unintentional humor--what a pain in the ass

[Chorus]
The pursuit of unintentional humor
Has worn me to the bone

Oh no it’s about to be something serious
Soul System
Soul System
Get them cAb
Yeah
It’s all you boy


[Verse 1: cAb]
Dead town flow
Living with the wicked
In the [?] where the system
Make it hard for us to get it
Grinding every minute
Looking for the clouds
With the silver lining in it
I'ma fill my lungs with it
High off life
That’s if you didn’t get it
I’m just trying to paint an image
Worth them paying the attention
Top dog ain’t no honor in the mention
On a mission since the water took the village
Dealing with the demons
They just fucking up the vision
The homies got you ducking
At the functions no kidding
I’m just spitting how I’m living huh
Man mother fuck opinions
Cause these niggas always giving ‘em
The new black react with no exact target
They take our brothers
And they wonder why we act heartless
Damn them white devils call it black hearted
But it’s hardly my concern
Though they make it hard to earn
Roll another let it burn
Taking turns with it
Plead the fifth on the third
Beat the first sentence
All that shit on the curb
That’s the worst feeling
Kill these niggas with a verse
Bring a hearse with you
Church


[Interlude: Dj Genre]
Man he’s out his mind
Hey yo hey yo
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Back him up come on back him up

Dead town flow
Coming for the soul of Casey Anthony
Lyrical miracle
The mission for the man to see
Murder on the corner
Mourn the morbid corpse the empathy
The soul of Casey Anthony
Bitch I'm about handle these
Rolling down the street
Accompanied by tumbleweed beneath
High noon all you hear
Is mice squeak beneath your feet
Death war strife famine talk about apocalypse
Hope you don't forget AKs and the banana clips
Place a bet and move the chips
It'll be a long seven years before you realize
You rocked the wrong crucifix
It'll take a crew to fix
Your ludicrous jones for sticks and stones
Why you acting like you new to this
Bitch you know the shoe'll fit
Give me the loot or give me a smile
I'll take my dick and knock your front teeth out
Sucking on my dick
Bitch you probably got a big mouth
Meaning you a snitch
Bitch you about to get put out
Of dead town (flow boy)
The lyrical general
Is fiddling with word minerals
Got to force a bar crystal
The verse is the clip
And the beat is the pistol
The songs the trigger
I won’t miss you

When you sub come you get numb, let the intro run, prepare the snare its more fun
Cos it's just begun and this part, Its part one!

Cos its high tide, represent, represent the raw side
Jump straight off the balcony then dance straight thru the floor sign
Can't hide, this one is made from shots (?) is not the more sky (?)
Already was an anthem now we've doubled in this lime light
Fire fight, somebody who's not moving I don't mean I
I can't swear we won't brake the stare and take you right there
So don't glare, get into it, bust it bring it right on, the times on
And nobody can tell us that the times wrong

Better believe it when I say, We'll be still rocking any

As in the life of rain
You're only alive when you're falling
The coldest chill
In the emptiness of reason

[Chorus]
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final with nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final, it begins today

So light up the days
With the darkest of waking dreams
For endless puzzles
To reflect our aim

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final with nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final, it starts today

[Bridge]
It seems you've passed the mark
Of indescribable dark
I fear you've drowned
In hope of what you think will come


Extracted from the sharpest of moments
Built to greet you when the time will come
Empty spaces on foundations of denial
Your structure is dust

[Verse 3]
As in the death of dream
Awakenings will leave you stranded
Where no one is listening
Where no one is around

So if you're looking for a good time and you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for, everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it, she'll teach you more than you can know

When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reaching the age of forty I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know, You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22, The Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life? Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way? Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down The Avenue the way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street everybody stops and turns to stare at you

Beat her, mistreat her -- Do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her -- Make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her -- She can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her -- She always does what you want

You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning

Your life's good, don't you know that you're hurting?

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you

Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
You're out to save the world

Should be on your shoulders

There's more to life than what you see

And no one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
Something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Pleading with Athos of the rock
In the ancient language which he spoke
But I didn't even give a damn
Because all I wanted to do was just sit back and talk

Talk about the restless winds that were blowing in my mind
That twisted all we grow as too thin
And feelings I had which I couldn't describe
And the places I'd come within

And in the chrome light I stood up and I just began
I'd sell my pride on a whim, let it blow
The righteous light that was guiding me still
And the man with the holy soul

Impatience took a dim view of my words
And let me down again
I'm so dusty, laden with all that world-weary stars and reverends

[Sung]
[Verse]
I've got your mother Mary, God
Life is empty, I wanna
Find some peace today
I said, mother Mary, oh
Life's so empty, I
Need some peace today, oh oh today


Oh those twisted corridors of power
In the ivory walls of hate
Where the eagle flies so proudly
And I just can't, just can't wait

In the victim's mind, he's ready
He is ready to exploit the weakness
Of the century's greed and feebleness
And the lies they whisper
To his brothers and sisters

Please Jesus, oh I love you
Won't you come to stay
Mother Mary, oh
Life is empty, I wanna
Find some peace today

Hannah hung around for the the rapture
On the roam for forty years
Of course no-one came, and you know I still live in fear
Always waiting for the prince of seventy-two
I was waiting for the world to fall apart, how about you?
If Husain could have waited
Nava could have seen the stars in the sky
Because I've been waiting for you for fifty odd years
I've been waiting for you through these hopes and these tears
I was waiting for you, I'm a-waiting for you

She doesn't like to use the word when she prays
I guess trusting is the hardest part of having faith
It's dangerous to hope that things will be okay
Well maybe fog and fear keep our eyes from seeing clear
I think Sydney could be right, she could be right
But if the stars that shine are in any way a sign
I think someone's out there putting up a fight
Someone's right here holding us tonight
Frederick rarely hears the voice of God
He says the silence is the answer most of all
When the world has explanations for every miracle
How else would we have ears to hear him call?
It's not a steady rain, it's more a longing or a pain
It's in the aching that he knows there's something more
Well I have never heard even a single spoken word except the rhythm of a wave upon the shore
Like watching dancers through a crack in the door
Well my grandpa says commitment is the key to love
Fifty years of sometimes twilight, sometimes dawn
He says there were the years he wasn't sure about
But the love he chose was worth the pressing on
Well I'm a river's flow, some days I'm fast some days I'm slow
I think Grandpa could be right, he could be right
Some days I fill the edges, then I'm shallow and pretentious
It all depends upon the rain I got that night
I should never base my faith upon my sight
I must decide where I am flowing, decide where I am going
So when I'm full of deep unknowing I'll still see
When the silence gets accusing, when I'm winning or I'm losing
Does assurance come from choosing to believe?

Far away from the ice and snow
Take me to where the air is sweet
Wind in my hair and sand at my feet

I'm taking it all in stride
Hoping the water's wide
And we will dive in deep and stay at sea

Voices are calling, I don't know who
'Cause the only one that I hear is you
Laugh with me shy like the day we met
And let's go to places we haven't yet

A shiver reminds me that I'm at home
But your hand on my back says I'm not alone

Oh, but outside our window an ocean view

Hoping the water's wide

Even sewed them some clothes for Christmas

Dress is laid out nicely on the bed
A song is singing slowly
Across the street and through my door
And turning over memories in my head
Nothing feels new today
I'm just trying to catch the words before they float away
They're singing
Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Morning by morning, morning by morning, morning by morning
Walking up the church steps, I stop to look around
People seem to stare just like they know
I'm wondering what Jesus thinks about me now
Still carrying a shame I can't let go
Nothing feels new today
I'm just trying to catch the words before they float away
They're singing
Mercy sounds so holy, for people who are wise
And tears are falling softly on my dress
I feel like an imposter wearing someone else's prize
And my heart's about to beat out of my chest
Nothing feels new today
I'm just trying to catch the words before they float away

Aight, it's rollin'

And I think of all the things, what you're doin'

Juggle me, i'm best friends with technic
1200's, and dj's who never fronted
I know i can can, like the pointer sisters
Hot commodity item, like porno pictures
Use what i choose and don't play to lose
For people who diss hip-hop, i got a short fuse
But irregardless what they think, what you want
Jungle drums full of bass for your trunk to pure funk
Raw lyrics spice it up like cayenne
Never on me or my skills do i be lyin
But steady fryin your brain with tight beats
Open your eyes, now you might see
Juggle me, i'm best friends with technic
1200's, and dj's who stay blunted
Runnin 'til the well runs dry
E-swift never run out of beats, no need to answer why
(that's right) and that means we're infinite
And when you're infinite -- you're never limited
And word up, ain't nobody could hold me
All star in the mix tape league, i average 40

Don't let the enemy get too close
Strike first, strike hard, then we ou-tro we ghost
Send the message that we're not to be touched or played with
Intentional foul is straight flagrant
Respect me and respect due

Took a picture or two, yo you're still not likwit crew

I'm here to do my do, mr. defari herut
Rhymes shine like the diamonds from the deepest mines of africa
I'm like your high tech cameras
Amazing to all those who watch
I rock a g-shock watch, half moon, and classic reeboks

The golden days, let it rain
Let the technic 1200 spin, let the music play
All eyes on the dj
Aiyyo i stay just west off the four-oh-five freeway
Feel free, use some leeway (uhh)
Run this again, make this your instant replay
We gets down, hot cuts, hot mix
I wants millions to know about me like chopsticks
The necessity
. is that i always keep a new mixtape baby, right next to me
Or within near proximity
Cause anywhere i hear hard beats is my vicinity
Lyrically i do surgery
You can go to germany, and ask if they heard of me

Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

[Chorus]
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (Thank you, ooh)
For all that you've done and still do (Still do)
You got me, I got you
Together, we always pull through

[Post-Chorus]
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother


[Verse 2]
It was the day that he turned on the kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Sayin' over and over and over
""You deserve much more than this""
She was so sick of believing the lies, and tryin' to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (Cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life (Oh), she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

[Chorus]
Oh mother, we're stronger (Hey, oh)
From all of the tears you have shed (All of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back (Yeah)
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (He'll never hurt us again)
So mother, I thank you (Thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (Still do)
You got me, I got you ('Cause, yeah, you got me and I got you)
Together, we always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again
For every time he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again


[Chorus]
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (Whoa)
Oh mother, oh mother, don't look back again
Don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (Thank you for all that you've done)

For all that you've done and still do

[Verse 1: Aly]
It took too long, it took too long, it took too long
For you to call back
And normally, I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday, my stupid birthday
I played along, I played along, I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously, my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

[Pre-Chorus: Aly, AJ]
The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
Don't let me go
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

[Chorus: Aly & AJ]
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'

You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me

Oh, baby, please, please tell me

We got along, we got along, we got along
Until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that? Let me repeat that
I want my stuff back

[Pre-Chorus: Aly, AJ]
You can send it in a box
I don't care, just drop it off
I won't be home
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Minus you, I'm better off
Soon you will know

[Chorus: Aly & AJ]
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me


[Bridge: Aly]
You can try, you can try
You know I know it'd be a lie
Without me, you're gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly mess up
A situation that you're gonna miss dearly, dearly, c'mon

Kickin' ass and raising thunder
Burnin' up my fuels
Fighting crime
Kick a bad guy down the garbage can
Get on a date with superman, fly the sky, just because I can
I'll be so pretty, never feel shitty
'Cause I'm a well respected lady superhero in the city
Yes I'll be doin' fine
But then I fall off, my cloud again
Brings me back to who I really am
I'm just little old me
Dealing with the same old things

[Hook]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why's my life so boring
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's gotta be a little bit more in store for me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why's my life so boring
Oh, I'm up for a little bit more
Just a little somethin'

[Verse 2]
Oh why can't I be just an ordinary girl
Bread and cheese for breakfast every day
Show my cookin' skills off, cause I'm in love with my oven clove
Give me something to dust off! I'm going crazy!
Never lazy, Oh life is wonderful
With coffee two sugars and the bold and the beautiful
I'm still single, but I feel ditched
I can't believe Ridge really married that bitch
Oh! This ordinary life is a waste
And I'll never own a red cape
But still my mind can fly and bake you perfect apple pie!
Cause were all little old me's
Dealing with the same old things!


[Hook]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why's my life so boring
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's gotta be a little bit more in store for me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why's my life so boring
Oh I'm up for a little bit more!

[Verse 3]
Well I'm a, twisted sistah, but sweet I remain
In this crazy inner world is where I spend most days
Tryin' to amplify my heart and find a brain that works
I'm calling on various characters
To make this crazy boring bubble burst

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are we meant to be sheep in the heard!?
That's my word, and the trouble I find
The world ain't so dull man
It's all in our mind
Where we're all little old me's
Dealing with the same old things!

[Hook]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why's my life so boring
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's gotta be a little bit more in store for me

Screaming, ""Big girl, you are beautiful!""

You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you ""baby""

I Just hope she stays with me

[Bridge: Fergie]
You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This ""love sick"" thing

My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
[Verse: Carmen Winstead]
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's
Your time starts now

Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

[Pre-Chorus]
A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up because the music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do
And then it's reaching inside you
Forever preaching, ""Fuck you too""
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you, twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breasts, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror

Pain, pain!

Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine

Ooh, I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My band is bigger than yours

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Too bad, I got your beans in my bag
You stuck-up sucker, Korny motherfucker
Taking over flows is the Limp pimp
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill
Ya best step back 'cause I'ma kill, I'ma kill
So, what you thinking, Mr. raggedy man?
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Ann

[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
Check you out, punk, yes, I know you feel it
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video
You little faggot ho
Please give me some shit to work with
'Cause right now I'm all it, kid
Suck my dick, kid, like your daddy did


[Verse 3: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? (Me)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that ""are you ready?""
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers
Nappy hairy chest, look, it's Austin Powers (Aw, yeah, baby)
I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes, clod
But you said it best, there's no place to hide

[Verse 4: Jonathan Davis & Fred Durst]
What the fuck ya saying? You're a pimp, whatever, Limp dick
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying
Wanna be Funkdoobiest when you're playing
Ripping up a bad counterfeit, faking
Plus your bills, I'm paying
You can't eat that shit every day, Fred
Lay off the bacon
Say what, say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth, Jon

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & Fred Durst]
So, you hate me
And I hate you
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah)
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what?
It's all in the family


[Verse 5: Jonathan Davis]
Look at you, fool, I'm gonna fuck you up twice
Throwing rhymes at me like, oh shit, alright, Vanilla Ice
Ya better run, run while ya can (Say what?)
Can never fuck me up, Bisc Limpkit (Say what?)
At least I got a P.H.A.T. original band

[Verse 6: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
Who's hot, who's not? (You)
You best step back, Korn on the cob (Okay)
You need a new job (Ha)
Time to take them mic skills
Back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill (Fuck you)
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders, while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away (Get a-gay)
Because it's doomsday, kid, it's doomsday

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & Fred Durst]
So, I hate you!
And you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah, yeah, you got it)
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah, yeah)


[Verse 7: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
You call yourself a singer? (Yep)
You're more like Jerry Springer (Oh, cool)
Your favorite band is Winger (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yeehaw)
It's just too bad that you're a fag and on a lower level

[Verse 8: Jonathan Davis & Fred Durst]
So you're from Jacksonville, kicking it like Buffalo Bill
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees (Oh yeah?)
Waiting for your little peanut

[Verse 9: Fred Durst & Jonathan Davis]
Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother
Your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh)
It's just too bad your father's mad, your mother's now your lover

[Verse 10: Jonathan Davis]
Come on, hillbilly
Can your horse do a fucking wheelie?

How did it start?
Well, I don't know, I just feel the craving
I see the flesh, and it smells fresh
And it's just there for the taking

They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated
I fill them up, I can't give it up
The pain that I'm just erasing

Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show ya, so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down, and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music, we can use it, be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama

For every person I've tried to be
There's another ten inside
I love you so much

It ain't fading
Man, I gotta let it out
Am I crazy?
Screaming, nothing ever comes out

I keep feeling lost
I'll never find my way out
I'm not thanking them
Unless the truth can pour out

Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing? Am I funny?
I hate inside, I hate inside

[Chorus]
I'll take this time
To let out what's inside
‘Cause I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die

Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride
And all this hate
Is bottled up inside


[Verse 2]
My heart's breaking
Man you really ripped it out
You take pleasure
Watching as I claw my way out

The hurt's rising
Soon it's gonna to tear my soul out
It's not kosher
Feeling like I'm on my way out

Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing? Am I funny?
I hate inside, I hate inside

Feeling a rush, but naught has changed

Trailing a rope I still perceive
Color our hair as blacks goes grey

Indistinguishable from one another
No possible intention to even bother
It doesn't matter what is said or how we say it
Coincidentally
We all sound exactly the same
We all want to swindle kids out of their money
If you're still doing this because you believe in it
You are so fuckin' lame

[Pre-Chorus 1: Celia Euringer]
Yo supe que nadie iba a comprender tu musica,  pero tú no me hicíste caso. Yo te dije, no te vistas en color rosa

With too many bands
Who's it time for?
Mark Chapman
(HEY) When they all seem absurd
Who will thin out that herd?
Ladies and gentlemen
Mark Chapman
(NOW) There is no heart
There is no fear
We all just cry the same old tear
Don't look to me
I do not lead
I'm just in front and they're following


Some other motherfucker without the balls and cojones to take hold of the reins and use 'em

[Verse 2: Jimmy]
Why is something so obvious so elusive?
There is nothing on the menu that won't turn abusive
I am part of the problem, not the solution
I'm just a prisoner
In the same prison as you
We wait for all the shoes to fall into position
Already obsolete
No one will miss us at all

Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone

Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher

There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

[Verse 2]
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away

Oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

[Bridge]
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again


[Verse 3]
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke, oh well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time

I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nightclubs
Just looking for a place to play
Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

[Verse 2]
Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis
I run out to money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
""There ain't no room around here for a guitar man""
""We don't need a guitar man, son""

[Verse 3]
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
Show them, son


[Verse 4]
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Digging the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man

[Verse 5]
Well, I came a long way from the car wash
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really have not got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm going to get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know

And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

[Verse 2]
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

[Verse 4]
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way


[Verse 6]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

[Verse 7]
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows

Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives, we're stuck in the undertow
But you know the places I wanna go

You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door

Just let go

I can't get enough, shakin' me up, turn it up
Alright, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop, make your heart drop and come alive

[Verse 2]
We could
Pack up and leave all our things behind
No fact or fiction or storyline
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
You're oh oh
Like air, I can't stop my breathing in
I'm weak and you were my medicine
I won't stop till I am under your skin

Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell?

It's too late baby, there's no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud
This is how I do, when I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time

[Chorus]
'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

[Verse 2]
I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

[Chorus]
You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?


[Verse 3]
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

When the moon is gone forever
I hope you're up there somewhere

Faces of lonely daughters and mothers who care
But just can't be there
Swear that I will see you someday
I have to find a way to show you I care
Even if you're not there

I wanna scream
Until no sound comes out and you've learned your lesson
I wanna swallow these pills to get to sleep
So I don't have to make a bad impression

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to start to be myself
'Cause I'm sick of everybody else

[Chorus]
I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now, I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man

[Verse 2]
I wanna run, but only far enough to make you miss me
I wanna take back all the shit that I have done
But I guess you were better off without me

[Pre-Chorus]

But I will stand a broken man

Today is a winding road
That's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
Whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Today in the blink of an eye
I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
I tried
I tried to read between the lines, I tried to look in your eyes
I want a simple explanation for what I'm feeling inside
I gotta find a way out
Maybe there's a way out

[Chorus]
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, ""Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors""
I don't wanna ever love another
You'll always be my thunder
So bring on the rain
And bring on the thunder

Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know

I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
And now I'm itching for the tall grass and longing for the breeze
I need to step outside just to see if I can breathe
I gotta find a way out

Strike me down with lightning, let me feel you in my veins

When I was younger, I used to be wild
As wild as an elephant's child
No one could hold me down
No one could keep me around
Now it's your turn, take a shot
Baby, show me everything that you got
Maybe you can keep me alive
Maybe you can get in my mind
But it's only a matter of time

[Chorus]
Before I run far away
I need to take a holiday
Maybe it's a fall from grace
I gotta find a new place
A holiday
I'll set off on a new chase
I gotta see a new face
I need to take a holiday

[Verse 2]
My father, he was always wise
As wise as an elephant's eyes
He couldn't hold me down
He couldn't keep me around
So are you gonna take your shot?
It's the only one that you got
Maybe I'll go out on a limb
Maybe I'll jump in for a swim
When the lights go dim

And I don't have any clue where to go

Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's powers
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy!

""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a saviour
Of a pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's pow'rs and might""

Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightaway
This blessed babe to find

But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray

Smelled so good
Green flowed into my nose

You turned away

That fateful day
Green tell mе what was wrong
Didn’t have to go

I’m so alone


Green was thе dress you wore
When we did kiss
Green that I love no more
You slit your wrists
Red was the blood that flowed
Right at my feet
Red was my face that showed
I tried to speak

I loved you so much

And so did you
Green like your pale dead skin
It turns to blue

A ghostly ring

I got voices in my head that I just can't fight
While you're fast asleep, snorin' and the world's at rest
I'm plottin' I'm schemin', trying to evade an arrest
Like night comes, got me on the opposite of piety
I'm out late with the thugs, bein' a menace to society
Not really, but I just like how that sounds
I'm actually writing this song to get a deal so I can-

They say the early bird gets the worm, I'm so hungry
Only restaurant I eat at is a Denny's in Albany
If I'm eternally nocturnal, then I defy biology
Circadian rhythms mean a load of crap to me
You see, I can nevеr hold a decent job from 9 to 5
I'd get a gravеyard shift, but I'm way too fly
You can check me on the strip, fumbling outta the club
Trying to get to the bar before they yell ""last call!'
I ain't a raging alcoholic but I like to drink
Last night I mixed so much that my brain couldn't think
I was ridin' on the roof of my car, was swerving
Ghostriding at 40 miles, it was disturbing
Man, I tried to get help, even called a hotline
But the only time they see me was between two and five
When I told the fuckin' lady that was too early she told me I was hopeless, not even Jesus could save me

Night falls, danger look should be scary as hell[?]
I stay up late avoiding cemeteries and jails
Cause I know it, but I can't show proof

You're gonna die, I'm gonna kill you
You're gonna die, I'm gonna kill you
You're gonna die, I'm gonna kill you

Feeling all blue, I've got no more time
They all hate me because of my crime
Their threats come at me, their voices are loud
All to condemn me, face is still proud

You were my good friend, I saved you before
Thought you turned good now, but you asked for some more
You had to provoke me, so I beat you
Watched your skull bleed, so now I feel blue

You're gonna die, I'm gonna kill you

Looking right down, barrel of a gun

Delusions mock me, my best friend is dead

If I'm alive by the time you find this, it's a miracle
What else can be said, a vision quest with infrared
I'm at a dead end, I bled slow
From my chest, held my breath and did my mess and never let go
I lived a good life, I never had half-compromise a thing
And if I couldn't write, I'd think of other ways to optimize my living
No wife, no kids, no anchors
Hand over fist to withhold this info from the bankers
Don't know my neighbors, didn't take a village to raise me
Small-town mentality types thinkin I'm crazy
I ain't as weird as they paint me
Off color, I'm more gutter, punk, and ritzy
More glitz and glamour than others
Motherfuckers left me lonely in this designated corner
Had a couple walls that build upon, they made me a performer
Now shade me from the warmer weather
Save me from the slaughterhouse
That creeps between the pages where I try to hide my awful mouth
Speak discretely to the sheets that seem to be hollow
Punched a ladder full of holes, just for my swollen feet to follow
Support me all you want, don't let me drop a field of land
I'm not going to stop until God is my ceilin fan
Spare the lamb, save me from my former-self
That creeps between the pages as the line across and locks my self
Now this is my box, these are my walls
This is when time stops and I'm all that there ever was
And I'm all there ever is and I'm all that there ever will be
A freeze frame pine box soliloquy... Call me FRANCOIS


(Hook)
Call Me Francois (call call call me francois)
(Call call call me francois)

Take what you can; leave what you must
Because y'all comin with us, (motherfucker you comin with us)

Fill your bags with the rags that you wear and their necessities
Along with the dog-tags and family recipes
Rest in peace, if you arrest the pace, movin haste
God-speed you black empress, get dressed, we're late
She painted my head orange, carved my face with her tongue
Emptied out my insides and lit the candle behind my eyes
Had the strike of twelve to midnight, winter queen
Left with my life rival in a white limousine
When he made her dress twirl, it looked like a mushroom cloud
Everybody ducked down except for me, that's my destiny
He used a broken condom as a corsage
I watched him push the rusty pin through her prom dress into her heart
Kill me already; fill me with confetti
Crush me up and sprinkle me over their wedding and her pregnant belly
I wasn't ready to suppress these memories, undress the mammaries
Forget the family, streamline the enemy, design the penalty
Cruel and unusual, commit the felony, unfit for prison duty
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK STAR!
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK!

[Intro]
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before

[Verse]
Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days sleepless and you've seen it
You could see it in my face, I ain't been grinnin'
I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way prescription did to them went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out my bedroom, mail the ashes to my partner
Twist the spoon if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my friends all in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiments, when and if my head hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways


[Movement II]

[Intro]
""And if it's like that this whole time?""
If it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Mmm-mmm, mmm, we'll be alright
And if it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Stayin' up all night, but it's alright
And I been stayin' up the whole night, but it's alright

[Verse]
It's me and my nibbling conscience
You know, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been wrong for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we slumpin'
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
You know, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been wrong for the longest
This spin, I ain't sleepin- no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my aunt soon, I'm stupid, I stink
Stay in it, alright..? (Tired, I'm stayin' in...)

[Movement III]


[Instrumental]

[Movement IV]

[Verse]
I got my aunt's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec–
(And not by nothin' by myself)
My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think
I know Non' in there sleepin', she on the couch, that's my sister
Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love her
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be dumpin'
To tell the truth, I ain't supposed to be here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam
To tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends
Well, time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that you know
If your soul intact, let me know
Let me know before you lost
(Woah, hold up)

Down and out
I'm walking round my room
My eyes see your face
It will all blow over soon (soon)
I took my love and shared it 'round the place
I was in love with you, in my eyes I saw your face
Oh, take me back to what was yesterday (take me back)
In this life my love for you remains the same
So I won't cry

To be truly free, I've got to say what I need
No more running away

No more running for me
To be truly free, I've got to say what I need
No more running away
My life is in my hands, I've got to face up and stay

[Verse 2]
And I do what was done and done from the start
I always knew it was you in my soul and in my heart (you and only you)
Oh baby please don't go, you know you want to stay (stay with me for a while)
But know that if you stay I'll always be this way
So I breathe for a second, let me breathe
Breathe for a second, let me breathe
You gotta just let me

Who will stand and take the fall, be the one to heed the call
Take the lead, be the one to go and open up the door
Take control of this mess as we push to progress
Strive to get up on to the next step
Oh, but oh, it's hard going when you're low on cash flow
Gotta, gotta, gotta feed the fam, don't wanna look like an asshole
I'm told, ""Take your time to go for gold""
But I'm not the type to take when I'm not owed
And so I get busy money, money, minding, my own
Plant my seeds 'round my place so I reap what I sow

Had to learn the hard way to trust in my instincts, so it's

I know what you're going through
I'm the only one who can hear you
You are the only one, too
Who can hear me when I cry
I know if we really want to
We can have a forever after
We could stay but I don't see how:
Our love, it seems to only bring us down
Love does not conquer all
That's a fairy tail we've been told
To stop us hurting as we grow old
To give us hope that love is strong
And I suppose that I don't know
But when you know, let me know
I suppose, I don't know, but when you know

Might not be all that we're hoping for
We could be wrong and not the one at all
The life I have is good and oh so comfortable
I'm not even sure if I should just leave it all
But you say ""take a leap, how do you know until you try
Baby, you live once, that's why"". Stay true to you
And if I'm not what you need  then (??) what is good for you

You said to me, no I wasn't good enough
Couldn't make it all the way high
How could it be now
I could of had what it takes to do my own style
Call me a dreamer
But dreams can come true
And I knew, knew not to believe you
And I flew, away from the flock
Now you can't stop me, no one can stop me
Try as hard as you like might give me something solid to bite
You keep me motivated
Now when I think of you my fists get ready to fight
And I'm on tonight
Grab a hold of my soul
Yes I take it everywhere I go
And oh na na, when you're hating
You can slow up cos you're just motivating

[Chorus]
No, you can never be the one to take all
If the day come I know God will come call
Strike you down proper now, once and for all
It's the call of the people then the people come call
Risk to your hiding place come from afar
Thought you were smart but we are smarter
Never, thought it'd catch up then I did jack knifed you up


[Verse 2]
I had a dream, a dream to attain certain things
To live my life free, be at peace with everything
My higher ground brings you down face the floor so you can taste it
Hard to admit nothing you do could stop the pace and
Even if i was, to never breathe again
You'd be on someone else's d**k as soon as you can
Understand let me make myself perfectly clear
I used to love her but she doesn't know i'm here say
What you want, who you are, it's your thing
Sit back relax wait for truth to call in
And then again let's get back to the basics
What was it you did that gave me so much inspiration?

Lets not pretend that were ever real friends
What we ever had then was with all this tension
And yet how do you know you'll be the winner in the innings
I'd be the one to tell you but you better think again cause

[Chorus]
No, you can never be the one to take all
If the day come I know God will come call
Strike you down proper now, once and for all
It's the call of the people then the people come call
Risk to your hiding place come from afar
Thought you were smart but we are smarter
Never, thought it'd catch up then I did jack knifed you up


You don't believe in me, the beginning ever got me
Look who tried to knock me
Couldn't knock me down my heart is solid just like Rocky
Stood my ground, I do it all the time
Living out of bags just to leave you all behind
I tried and you tried to light the damn fire
But I couldn't see no burning desire
And even back then, were you pretending?
Not sure if I can call you a friend but
Feel free to lay your burden
I got near you just for listening
I can give it up but let's be real clear
You could have had it all but your heart was ruled with fear

So
What can i tell ya, no
I can not hold ya, no
Just like i told ya
You can come around but you can't get any closer

[Chorus]
No, you can never be the one to take all
If the day come I know God will come call
Strike you down proper now, once and for all
It's the call of the people then the people come call
Risk to your hiding place come from afar
Thought you were smart but we are smarter
Never, thought it'd catch up then I did jack knifed you up


Yes I will be polite
And smile to you face
But we can never get closer, closer, closer, no
And I will smile to your face

Chola Changa the swagger motherfucker

[Verse: MOLTISANTI]
Wake up and roll up the veggies
Tie my laces then chase the lettuce
Life a bitch tryna get in her leggings
Two options, hustle or perish
If I put in work then I earned it
I want both the cash and the credit
Gotta ask her 21 questions
Treat pillow talk like confessions
Yeah
Gotta confess to my niggas
If I ask for a feature
I been plotting to kill ya
Ain't no hard feelings, it's just music business
Sometimes it all falls down like a game of Tetris
Let's get it

[Hook: MOLTISANTI]
Bitch I’m fresher than a mafucka in my Chola Changa
Fresher than a mafucka in my Chola Changa
Bitch I’m fresher than a mafucka in my Chola Changa
Always looking dapper
Puffing on that dagga
Fresher than a mafucka in my Chola Changa
Fresher than a mafucka in my Chola Changa

Always looking dapper
Rasta sunga chamba


[Verse: NIMIE2906]
I ain’t gotta shine
For reflection
Memories of times Passed
Blunts passed
Wait I forgot my bus pass
Fuck it
The train faster
I’m next up
I’m here to fester
Not these type to seek attention
But when I’m rhyming
It seem to find me
I’m just defining
The world how I see it
Not a bull shitter
I tell it like it is
MOLTISANTI keep on hitting with those packages
I got blunts
But this music is my sedative
I’m certainly benevolent
Some bars are just irrelevant
What I’m weighing here
Is heaven sent
You cannot prevent
From breaking the scale
I came to engage
Like a renegade
On his way to the top
I’m on your face
So you know I’m pop
Relentless
So you know I won’t stop
When push comes to shove
You’re out of petrol
I’m gassed up
You can judge my gauges

Holding on to hearts still wounding
For those who've yet to find it
The place is near where love is moving
Cast off the robes you're wearing
Set aside the names that you've been given
May this place of rest in the fold of your journey
Bind you to hope
You will never walk alone
In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (Never walk alone)
In the shelter of each other
We will live
We will live (Your arms are all around us)
If our hearts are turned to stone
There is hope we know the rocks will cry out
And the tears aren't ours alone
Let them fall into the hands that hold us
Come away from where you're hiding
Set aside the lies that you've been living
May this place of rest in the fold of your journey
Bind you to hope
We will never walk alone
In the shelter of each other
We will live

If there is any war

Just remember it started with a seed
Every moment and every deed has made you are
And who you are is all you need
Life's an automobile
You just gotta grab the wheel
You never know what you'll uncover

Well, vintage cars don't randomly appear
Time can fool the eye, my dear, like no other

You still gotta chase it, chase it
So go and fly like you'll never forget
It's yours if you take it
'Cause life is what you make it

Don't need a wand to wave up high
For the soles of your feet to walk the sky
You gotta wake up
What if I ain't good enough?

Dude, you gotta strut your stuff
Wait up you better suit up

Maybe our luck has changed

Aw yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
I was born and raised the only son of a lawyer
'Til I was approximately the age of four or perhaps five
I lost both my mother and my father
Killed in a fire way up on the fourteenth floor
Struck down by the time I was ten by an illness
Which robbed me of the sight of the morning sun and that ain't all
A homeless child for the next five years
With my dog Clown by my side and my only friend, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fought my way through school
Sound and touch the thing on which I could depend
And you know what the, the, the kids
Down my street weren't too playful
And right then it seemed like the whole world picked on me and ah yeah
I worked my fingers to the bone
Stretchin' hide for a boot man in Jersey Town, woo
But then, but then I lost the last thing I had
When fate reared its ugly head and took my dog Clown
I wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman
16 years old and felt like a woman
But, but, but, but, but what I'm trying to say is
God, please don't take her away from me


[Chorus]
I lost everything that I ever had
You kicked my name into the dirt
Tread my name into the dirt, yeah
Oh, aw yeah, ha
I lost everything that I ever had
You kicked my name into the dirt
What could I do? Ooh

But it never ever come my way before

This isn’t what you’ve come to expect from Rod Stweart; it’s honest, heartfelt and quite beautiful.[Verse 1]
I think I know now what's making me sad
It's a yearnin' for my own back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride

[Chorus]
Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born

[Verse 2]
When the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weddin' suit and catch the evening train
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

[Chorus]
Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born

[Instrumental Break]


[Verse 3]
But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could
And if I'm called away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'll be asking of you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold

[Chorus]
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, won't you carry me home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back

As I was out walking on the corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay
His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor
I guess he'd been there for a whole night or more

[Chorus]
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to carry it on
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

[Verse 2]
A blanket of newspaper covered his head
The step was his pillow, the street was his bed
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And a fistful of money showed the coins that he'd bummed

[Chorus]
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
Leavin' nobody to carry it on
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

[Verse 3]
Does it take much of a man
To see a whole life go down
To look on the world
From a hole in the ground
Too late for your future
Like a horse that's gone lame
To lie in the gutter
And die with no name

Spent some time feelin' inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same
Daddy said, ""Son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread""
So I got out, woo

[Verse 2]
Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused, woo
I moved on

[Verse 3]
Down in Rome, I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk, woo
At a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was, yeah
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear, I better get out of here
'fore the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no


[Verse 4]
I moved right out east, yeah, listen
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people, I was glad I found her
Oh yeah, I was glad I found her, woohoo
Wait a minute

[Verse 5]
I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats
'Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off, ha
You didn't have to come here anyway

[Verse 1]
Wake up Maggie, I think I got somethin' to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used

[Chorus 1]
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone

[Post-Chorus 1]
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

[Verse 2]
The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax

[Chorus 1]
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone


[Post-Chorus 2]
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

[Verse 3]
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head

[Chorus 1]
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone

[Post-Chorus 3]
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band

You made a first-class fool out of me

Where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man, you'll find the old and young twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here, I don't know

I wouldn't even fly away
If I had one good reason to stay
But you said
If you don't need my love
I'm gonna find someone who does
And I'm not hanging around

She got tired of me
Staying out late everynight
I'd fall up the stair
Thought she'd always be there
But suddenly I'm alone
And I'm not accustomed to sleeping alone

She said if you don't need my love
I'm gonna find someone who does
You've stripped me of everything
And you've torn down all my dreams

Its been two long weeks
Since shes been gone
Thought I had her in the palm of my hands
She said I'm through, don't try to call me
Cause you won't even find me
Cause if you don't need my love
I'm going to find someone who does
And the heartache you've give me
You'll get it back just wait and see


Well, well, well, well
I'd give anything to hold her in my bed again
I just wanna feel her breath on my back
She said my blood can't give her love
No way

She said if you don't need my love
I'm gonna find someone who does
And I'm gonna take our child
Cause I don't want him running wild

Hey pal, I think they just called out your flight
Put down your glass don't forget your boarding pass
And if your looking or you found love

Don't play hard to get

Love to the loveless shown

You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas (The seas, the seas, the seas)
But you mean more, mean more to me (To me, to me, to me)
Than any colour I can see

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be, livin' in perfect symmetry
Nothin' is as down or up as us
As us

[Verse 2]
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

And all you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be, livin' in perfect symmetry
Nothin' is as down or up as us

And don't you wanna see it come soon
Floatin' in a big white balloon?
Or given on your own silver spoon?
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwin' your arms around
And say, ""You're not a moment too soon""?

Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me
And I could write it down or spread it all around

You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
Made me realize what I could not see

The world and then it took, it took it back from me

COMPETITION be The man in the mirror sun, Everyone's a teacher, but you probably only hearing one…
When you all alone, feeling like yaself again, Center your mind and your body then the help begins…
Losing all your health again, stressing over world things, Find the beauty like tune that your girl sings
Everyday we have to deal with the up and downs, Ponder long, it’s enough to make a brother frown
But why do it? Your life is worth countless, materials, but really it’s not about this…
Losing sleep, this ain't hard as calculus, They brainwash your spirit to start doubting this…
Will Power, we hold it in the soul so Ease Up, Breath up, Peace up and let it go…

Use your will power, Skill power, real power (CHANT) (8x's)

[Verse 2: Venomous2000]
Nothing is strong enough to hold you down forever…Momma was right, only you could make it better
Giving up is Never, not an option in my vocab, Through the pain, keep moving like the Nomads
Heart pumps power, so give it if you got it, Show your true self, don't try to camouflage it
Think, use logic, plus creativity, CLaim your birth right, your God given abilities
Pray for your enemies, to live to see you shine through, Plans lie ahead, don't worry about the side view
There's support in your back that's behind you, close eyes and tell SELF remind you
Push through, break it down, don't stop the bum rush, down for the count, Better realize there's no such…
WARRIORs…TELL THEM WHAT YOUR MADE OF….Is pure mind, pure strength, pure soul, and pure love…

만들어 버릴 적당한 머리와 돈이 조금 필요할 뿐

You know my wandering days are over
Oh, does that mean that I'm getting boring?
You tell me
I'm tired of listening to myself, yeah
I'm tired of fixing things for Michael and the rest of them

[Verse 2]
You know my bip-bopping days are over
I hung my boots up and then retired from the disco floor
The centre of my so called being is
The space between your bed and wardrobe with the louvre doors, with the louvre doors

[Verse 3]
You know ""My celibate days are over""
You put me straight on the finer points of my speech rehearsed
In the mirror of my steamy bathroom
Where the lino tells a sorry story in a monologue, in a monologue

[Chorus]
Six months on, the winter's gone
The disenchanted pony
Left the town with the circus boy
The circus boy got lonely
It's summer and it's sister song's
Been written for the lonely
The circus boy is feeling melancholy


[Verse 4]
It's got to be fate that's doing it
A spooky witch in a sexy dress has been bugging me
With the story of the way it should be
With the story of Sebastian and Belle the singer, yeah

[Verse 5]
You know my one man band is over
I hit the drum for the final time and I walked away
I saw you in Japanese restaurant
You were doing it for business men on the piano, Belle
You said it was a living Hell
You said you were in Hell

[Chorus]
Six months on, the winter's gone
The disenchanted pony
Left the town with the circus boy
The circus boy got lonely
It's summer and it's sister song's
Been written for the lonely
The circus boy is feeling melancholy

[Chorus]
Six months on, the winter's gone
The disenchanted pony
Left the town with the circus boy
The circus boy got lonely
It's summer and it's sister song's
Been written for the lonely

Back when Steve and Eva died that album changed my life
It was a package of pure darkness tied up with a silver string
Delivered by a fast train rearranging how I think
He said ""I can't believe you even know that I exist
I've got all of your albums and I think you are the best""
He started to cry and I started to laugh
I gave him a hug and he gave me his autograph
Reeling in my disbelief, I know that it was just a dream
All the covers that I see are different from the books I read

Everything is crumbling around me
Why does everything cost so much money?
Could somebody please help out my family?
My mom needs hearing aids, new shoulders, and new legs
My dad needs a break, he works all day every day
My brother needs a place and a job where he can make
Enough money to take care of his baby

Here's a simple dissertation on a complex situation
Money and intimidation and mass graves make strong foundations
For the giant corporations that own all the TV stations
Telling us to take vacations to their big theme park plantations
Rather than to hearts of nations

Where we might meet people on the street who say
""I don't want my MTV
'Cause it brought viva to its knees""
And mom and pop are begging ""please
Globalization's killing me""
While we think that they think they need all of the things we think we need
Like Martha Stewart, shams and sheets
And sugar free powdered iced tea
Vanilla Coke, Lemon Pepsi, 'Friends' episodes on DVD


I went to see the doctor of psychiatry
Weapons of mass instruction finally broke me
He said ""act your age, don't be afraid, take two of these
Now listen real hard, put down that guitar
Don't be a retard, be all that you can be""

The things he said I could be were laid out right in front of me
Would I choose deep fried apathy
McNuggets where my balls should be
Or super sized conformity?
I walked away and I'm still me
Free to go fucking crazy, free to know why I'm angry
One and one and one is three and you and me is all I need
Singing songs, drawing cocks, picking locks to locked doors
Find deflated hearts, and pump them up",en,"I dreamed I thanked Scott Ian for persistence of time Back when Steve and Eva died that album changed my life It was a package of pure darkness tied up with a silver string Delivered by a fast train rearranging how I think He said ""I can't believe you even know that I exist I've got all of your albums and I think you are the best"" He started to cry and I started to laugh I gave him a hug and he gave me his autograph Reeling in my disbelief, I know that it was just a dream All the covers that I see are different from the books I read Everything is crumbling around me Why does everything cost so much money?

Once, long ago, there was a time
In what now seems a distant land
Each small boutique
Was precious and unique
'Cause every little thing was made by hand
Then there came a revolution
The progress of production was its aim
Now instead of one, there are many
And each costs just a penny
But every single one is just the same

[Verse 1]
Now there's a
Starbucks on every bloody corner
McDonald's on everybody's street
There's White Castle, Wendy's, then Wal-Mart
And then it all repeats
If you're the kind that looks down on the masses
Even for you there's a feint
Get some New Rocks or a pair of Docs
Put just like those who ain't

[Chorus]
And that is how (Tell us how!)
It came to be (How can it be?)
After two long centuries
That in the name (What's in a name?)
Of human greed
The Industrial Revolution
Fixed everything for me


[Verse 2]
And so now if one does well with the business
They open two more, and then three
They buy in bulk, get big massive hulks
At which point it's nearly free
As they grow bigger, their prices get lower
Until they become a chain
The smaller stores all shutter their doors
And buckle 'neath the strain

[Chorus]
And that is how (Tell us how!)
It came to be (How can it be?)
After two long centuries
That in the name (What's in a name?)
Of human greed
The Industrial Revolution
Fixed everything for everyone
It came into our lives and gave us uniformity
By taking choice away from you and me
And that is how (Tell us how!)
It came to be (How can it be?)
After two long centuries
That in the name (What's in a name?)

Inspired by tales of Joan of Arc, Natasha is woken by a black horse at the window and sent on a fateful quest.[Verse 1]
Got woken in the night
By a mystic, golden light
My head soaked in river water
I had been dressed in a coat of armour
They called a horse out of the woodland
""Take her there, through the desert shores""

[Refrain]
They sang to me, ""This is yours to wear""
""You're the chosen one, there's no turning back now""

[Verse 2]
The smell of redwood giants
A banquet for the shadows
Horse and I
We're dancers in the dark
Came upon a headdress
It was gilded, dark and golden
The children sang
I was so afraid
I took it to my head and prayed

[Refrain]
They sang to me, ""This is yours to wear""
""You're the chosen one, there's no turning back""
They sang to me, ""This is yours to wear""

And ticking, she's brought to a boil

On craquelature from every fall
The daylight made to race quite by
With paint and paste and stitch and awl

Soon your audience admire
A shapely arabesque or three
I'll wind you up, you'll never tire.""

A frozen carmine mouth
Twinkles as she jerks and swoons

It’s not a nice surprise
I see it in your eyes
I think I chill you to the bone
There’s something in the night
It hides a strange delight
It offers words which tempt and twist
The watch fires burning bright
You’re only faking fright
And yet you’re helpless in its grip

And you’re such a little tease
I want to show you things unknown
I hear your knocking knees
As though your blood might freeze
I think my cover’s nearly blown
And now you start to sway
I think I hear you pray
Safe passage to your little home
You’ll never find the way
Listen to what I say
I’m going to take you for my own

Come hear the story, the power and the glory
The wretched tale of how we Shall never die again
And we’re demented, endlessly tormented
We're mean and malcontented
For evermore, amen

Your life shall be renewed

You look at me askew
Your lips are turning blue

It’s only company I seek
It’s not a glass of wine
But you’ll find it quite divine
It makes our evening quite complete

And the dew settles in my mind

When my plans were giggled in line

And his love brought a tear to my eye

What kind of fool am I
Who never fell in love?
It seems that I'm the only one
That I have been thinking of

What kind of man is this?
An empty shell
A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell

What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away
This mask of play
And live my life?

High up on the mountainside, there grows an ancient tree
Its story has been handed down, all through my family
A vile and twisted evil thing, that stood the test of time
Through wind and rain and hurricane and still, the tree's alive

[Chorus]
But tonight
It's coming down
I'm gonna put it on the ground
The Hanging Tree

[Verse 2]
The year was 1864 when a band of rebel men
Were captured by the Union boys, that's how the tale began
They hung em' up and shot em' and before they cut em' down
Their blood ran down the trunk and fed the roots down underground

[Chorus]
But tonight
It's coming down
I'm gonna put it on thе ground
The Hanging Tree
I've heard that it's been thеre since before the dawn of man
But I'm the one who'll bring it down tonight with these two hands
The Hanging Tree


[Verse 3]
In 1952, a young man sleepin' in his bed
Was waken by an angry mob with hoods upon their head
The cowards hung him from the tree, afraid to show their face
Convinced the evil thing they'd done, was strengthening their race

But tonight
It's coming down
I'm gonna put it on the ground
The Hanging Tree

And then he fell into a world of alcohol and pills

Here in northeast Ohio

Found the ore that was lining Yellow Creek
They built a blast furnace
Here along the shore
And they made the cannonballs
That helped the Union win the war

Kept them hotter than hell

A job that would suit the devil as wеll
Taconite coke and limestonе
Fed my children and made my pay
Them smokestacks reaching like the arms of God
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay

When he come home from World War Two
Now the yard's just scrap and rubble
He said ""Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do""
These mills they built the tanks and bombs
That won this country's wars
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam
Now we're wondering what they were dying for

Rich enough to forget my name

Oh, you thought that I was playin'?
I do albums in my sleep so while you dream of gettin' paper
I
Cause nightmares like you seein' Satan
I showed up at Summer Jam, I was feelin' like Son Of Sam
Just lookin' at the stage in a rage, this is stupid yo
I'm standin' here mad at myself so I hit the studio
And wrote this
No hit record
No underground
This a reflection from starin' at Stevie Wonder's sound
It started in the 2nd grade
Now I'm kinda gettin' paid
I have never been afraid
Frustrated maybe with my label situation
Someone called it complainin' but it's label ventilation
And every month I'm droppin' like menstruation
If I didn't let it out I'd probably be a mental patient
In the psych ward
Tears fallin', lookin' out the window
I don't like fightin', if I do I'm tryin' to win though

[Chorus]:
Till the day, sometimes I cry
Time, I don't know why
Seasons can't change the time
I will always win the fight
Till the day, sometimes I cry
Time, I don't know why
Seasons can't change the time
I will always win the fight


[Verse Two]:
A lot of dudes say a bunch of nothin'
That's why I'm on a Rampage like Busta's cousin
I'm up to somethin'
To intertwine fluff and substance
The hip hoppers gon' feel it and the thugs will love it
And the girls?
Ha
Well that's a whole 'nother story
I gave 'em Love Jones, they zoned and fell for me
I gotta keep the clubbin' dudes bouncin'
At the same time I'm on that Usher vibe to Move Mountains
And you can smoke a spliff on a cliff
Then you wouldn't be close to a fifth of the gift
That the Lord gave me
They ask will I run out of rhymes
I'm more afraid that I'mma run out of time
Let's go Stevie

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Look
And people say I dissed Wayne but I didn't say anything
Rude, it's just when dudes think that they can say anything

And money goes up for shows
You travel across the globe, I think that that's wonderful

Only difference is, I ain't tryin' to get comfortable

I want the cars and the homes, yeah I made goals
For myself but I'm still on a mission to save souls

Ordinary pain
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart

[Verse One]:
I don't really think these girls understand
One day I wanna be a one woman man
Fall deep in love, take you by the hand
Walk down the aisle, have a child, raise a fam
But um
Right now
Right now?
I feel like I'm under a bright cloud
And the sun is starting to shine down
I wasn't lookin' for this but I found it
What can I do I got so many choices
Everywhere I turn I'm hearin' these voices
Like ""Stimuli""
""Hello?""
""Stimuli""
""What's up?""
""Stimuli can I get a little time?""
All this can't be just from spittin' rhymes
Maybe it's a trick and it's all in my mind
I am not a player, no I am not a pimp
Never been a mack, I don't even trick


[Chorus]:
I got, so many {x4}
I got, too much {X4}

[Verse Two]:
How can you be what they call ""a good dude""
When you know at home you got that cooked food
But when you out you want your food fast
And you know McDonalds and Wendy's will give you gas
But you still eat it
Sorta like the girl that you just really meetin'
But you still beat it
Pray you don't seed it
Why even do it?
Cause it's so easy, but you feel stupid
I just do music, I mind my business
I don't even want this, God's my witness
But I do kinda like it
So many ladies and I do try to fight it
Walk in the spot and they do get excited
This is what happens when you trapped in the light
The camera, the action, you got to believe me
That's why this is dedicated to Stevie
Soon as the girls see your face on the TV
Even on Youtube, then they wanna do you
And what do you do?
You try to run away, I swear I'm so afraid


[Chorus]:
I got, so many {x4}
I got, too much {X4}
Look I wanna love you but I love her too {x4}

[Verse Three]:
What do you do when your girl is a dime?
Woman of your dreams, love her beauty and her mind
Everything you wanted, she is all that combined
But you still got you a thing on the side
It's just, too much
Too much
We always have to do us
But if she was to go and do stuff
You would prolly cry, scream out ""Why?""
Wanna go fight, call the dude, get mad
Just cause you ain't cherish all the goodness you had
I've had girls complain about they man while puttin' they clothes on
I felt so wrong

I don't know what it was that, made me cold
Had a chip on my shoulder since, 7 years old
Something snapped in my way of living, hit me in my soul
I started, seeing the future, I started, losing control
I don't know what it was that, made me cold
Had a chip on my shoulder since, 7 years old
Something snapped in my way of living, hit me in my soul
I started, seeing the future, I started, losing control
Saw death in my hallway, gun shots woke me up
Crack files every where, families was broken up
Maybe it was seeing Momma crash, I was choking up
Doc said paralysis, it was so miraculous
Sorta like Jesus when he walked back Nazareth
Maybe seeing (??)
Setting off, letting off, young Black activist
(??) just sick flow, captavist
Caught in the web of the whip where the schools turn
Six out of ten little kids into fools got
One with a toolie, other two get abused and
And one writing verses trying to be cool turned cold

[Verse 2: Sha Stimuli]
Look, I'm so cold like Andre
3000, keep browsing, had a few fiances
Calling me, honking me, asking me always
""When get gon' be together"", I would say I wanna stay
With you but I can't right now I gotta go and then
She asked ""Why?"", I said I got a show she ask
Can she come, and instead I'm saying no, I say
You just did, now please, leave me alone, I was hurt
By a girl that resembled you, I let her do a thing I was respectable
Then she had to let my dude sleep with her, creep with her
Once I saw a message to her, ""Sha will never find out
Maybe wanna execute?""
You gotta get used to me
I got an ice-box where my heart used to be
I'm used to three or four chicks at a time, having lines
Waiting outside, I know it's about time, I'm a change man",en,"I don't know what it was that, made me cold Had a chip on my shoulder since, 7 years old Something snapped in my way of living, hit me in my soul I started, seeing the future, I started, losing control I don't know what it was that, made me cold Had a chip on my shoulder since, 7 years old Something snapped in my way of living, hit me in my soul I started, seeing the future, I started, losing control Saw death in my hallway, gun shots woke me up Crack files every where, families was broken up Maybe it was seeing Momma crash, I was choking up Doc said paralysis, it was so miraculous Sorta like Jesus when he walked back Nazareth Maybe seeing (??)

I'm on this path, about to blow
Sometimes, I just don't know
I
Lately I've been feelin'
Lately I've been feelin'

[Verse One]:
Lately I keep thinkin' 'bout my funeral
Lately I keep seein' how life is beautiful
So lately I ain't been doin' the things I used to do
And I stare at the mirror like, ""What am I gonna do with you?""
And I'm talkin' to my life
And life stays answers back, ""We'll be alright.""
But lately it's been tough to really write
And lately I just don't give a damn about bein' nice
Cause I was sittin' there watchin' MTV
And they was runnin' off The Hottest Top 10 MCs
They had, Lupe, Kanye, Wayne, Jay-Z
And I'm thinkin'
What I need for them to mention me
Forget it
Lately I need a lot of counselin'
A lot of obstacles in front of me, I got around 'em
Lately I keep hearin' how hot the south is
And e'rybody soundin' like Roger Troutman
But that's a good thing maybe
I'm not really focused on the hood things lately
I'm not stressin' if the radio will play me
And lately, I ain't buggin' if some label out there pays me


[Hook]:
I'm on this path, about to blow
Sometimes, I just don't know
I
Lately I've been feelin'
Lately I've been feelin'
Like I need
More than a flow
More than the fame
More than the dough
Lately I've been feelin'
Lately I've been feelin'
Down

[Verse Two]:
I feel like the strength and the power of God is in me
I'm so centered, call me ? or maybe not
Lately a lot music crowds are soft
It really sounds like nothin'
Cause people hate substance
But then they want change, no matter what I love it
Ask how the game's treatin' me, I answer, ""I'm above it.""
So lately I be up in the clubs and I'm zonin'
To what they feel and sometimes poppin' the bub' or the Vodka but not a lot
If you see me
I'm with some thugs or some dime lookin' ladies
I've been gettin' love lately
I've been walkin' in the street and sometimes I get spotted
It feels kinda cool cause lately I'm gettin' hotter
But chicks want tricks and I'm lookin' like Harry Potter
So I gotta be careful and watch 'em cause they be plottin'
I ran into this shawty with a package so tough
She had the narrowest gut and a fabulous butt
She said she loved that song called Back Of The Bus that I did
And then she asked if I was married and stuff
""Any kids?""
I said, ""No
Before you keep up the interrogation
Just know I really wrote that song about public transportation
And lately I've been sorta late with all my payment makin'
So if you want me for my dough that's a mistake you makin'.""
And she laughed and said, ""You funny Sha
Lately I don't even care about money Sha.""
And last week I seen her get in Sha Money's car
I guess I got a ways to go, that's why I'm comin' hard
Cause a lot of what we listen to ain't up to par
I can't turn back now I done come too far

The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through you tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so

""These three words""

[Verse One]:
I don't know if I can say it
And then if I say it I don't know how you gon' take it
I don't even know what to call it when we naked
I said it's ""sex"" you said, ""love making""
I thought that it was lust
You call it ""trust"" I said you gave it up
You met my moms like once
You said it's been years, I counted like 30 months
But I guess that's the same
That's why she left, she said I was playin' games
Last week I saw her, I was walkin' to the train
She was drivin' in a Range, lookin' good, I said, ""I love you girl.""
But I don't think that she heard
I don't know why I couldn't just say the words
I hardly said 'em to my father
Maybe as a kid but it got a little harder
As I got older I really didn't bother
Same for my grand mom, both of 'em passed on
And then I'm at the church
Missin' my folks, feelin' like the worst
Not knowin' if they knew what they were worth
Maybe that's why that shawty was so hurt
Damn


[Chorus]:
It's so hard to say
It's much easier to walk away
Then say ""I love you""
It's so sad and wrong
That I can probably use a rap or a song to say ""I love you""
I can say ""I got love""
I can say ""I care for you""
I can say ""I really like you""
I can say ""I'm there for you""

[Verse Two]:
Look, I've been horizontal with a lady that I swore I love
I'm for real, I felt it, I adored her
Her look, her smell, cute face, waist small
She would always through the 'L' word out and I would stall
I'd say I'd care, ""You the best girl you dope.""
She would say, ""I love you."" I would say, ""No you don't.""
Stop playin', I would try to change the subject
I would say, ""Stimuli's the person that you're in love with.""
And I think that she cried
But I don't remember cause I was still inside her, I think it was November
She was gone December, I kinda took it hard
So I wrote the three words at the end of a Christmas card
She ain't care though


[Chorus]:
It's so hard to say
It's much easier to walk away
Then say ""I love you""
It's so sad and wrong
That I can probably use a rap or a song to say ""I love you""
I can say ""I got love""
I can say ""I care for you""
I can say ""I really like you""
I can say ""I'm there for you""

[Verse Three]:
I think I don't tell my mother too much
And I don't tell my brother enough
And I don't tell my friends at all
You wanna hear it just spin this song
I guess that's wrong
See I'm tryin' to grow, I feel like I'm about to blow and that's scary
Cause every time that I get poppin' I'm losin' those people that's near me
Can you hear me?
I love my team and I love my fam so does that mean
If I don't say it will they know their dreams are mine and vice versa
Will I be a trife person if I don't tell everyone that ever believe?
If I try to give folks what I think that they need
In place of what they want
Will I seem real mean if I change my number after gettin' more cream?
If I don't say it, is that wack?
If I don't say it, it's in the track
If I don't say it, it's in my actions
If I don't say it just run this back

The first time I did it, I felt like a stupid lil' kid tryna' get it
After 20 minutes, 300 hundred dollars in my pocket
I was quitting that job that I had the day before
Dog, I was making more money in a day then I made in two weeks
But I felt to weak, at night I would lose sleep
Be conversing with a person, and hearing this dude speak
He looked like an average guy, then I see his ass get high
As he was walking away, I wanted to ask him why
But my position is simply, it's just demand, supply
But I keep on imaging
The addicts that I see, is life that bad for them
Is breathing really stressing you, is being a mom that difficult
You gotta smoke some drugs to be calm, I'm doing no harm
There's no real excuse cause I'm wrong
But I feel better once I tell them put that loot in my palm and then I'm gone

I wanna take y'all on a journey right quick. A lot of people talk about Heaven and Hell. I don't know

[Verse One]:
Look
They say Heaven ain't hard to find, but I think it depends on who's lookin'
They say Heaven might be all in my mind
So it could be somewhere in Brooklyn
'Pac asked if there was a Heaven For A G
I don't know the answer but I wonder in my sleep
About all the killers and the dealers that I see
For sellin' somebody death, is there a Heaven for me?
Nas asked if it was a mile away
Would you drive to it, walk to it, or would you stay?
Right where you are, cause you might be afraid
That paradise would change you, you'd never be the same
Biggie said he never even wanted to go
Too many goodie goodies, no weed, no hoes
I just wanna know if I'm sinnin' on the low
But it comes to the light when I'm done with my life is it over?

[Chorus]:
They say that heaven is
A ten zillion light years away
And just the pure of heart
Will walk a righteous street someday


[Verse Two]:
Follow
There's so many church goers in my family
And one day we spoke about Christianity
I thought they would all be pissed and mad at me
When they heard my music, but I felt real stupid
When they said I had a gift
And I was bound to spread hope and guidance
With my words, said I had the Holy Ghost inside me
But it's gonna take time for my quotes to shine
And have God's power, right now, I'm just close
And on the real, I don't know if I believe
That taking Christ as my savior will achieve
This afterlife of greatness, he sacrificed for our needs
And I thank him, but I just might wanna follow his lead
And maybe that'll be my Heaven
Tell the truth, I got serious in '97
B.I.G. passed and I thought about death
And I thought about what I could leave after I left
So I started writin' crazy and I did my best
To live through my music after I'm out of breath
That's why I hate sleepin', cause it's hard to accept
The fact that we gotta die, my mind won't ever rest
If I sell a million copies, will the gates fly open?
If I'm in church every Sunday will that mean I'll be chosen?
If I don't cheat, lie, steal
Fornicate or murder will I get to live forever?
If that's the case I'll be perfect
Where's Heaven man?


[Chorus]:
They say that heaven is
A ten zillion light years away
And just the pure of heart
Will walk a righteous street someday

[Sha talking]:
And then I start thinkin'. What if Heaven's on Earth? Follow me

[Verse Three]:
Look
You give a homeless man a crib, a blind man vision
A deaf dude wakin' up hearin', you gotta listen
Take a single mother raisin' her kids, on her own
And have her man change his life for his fam and come home
Or a nice MC stayin' true to what he knows
Then he finally, gets a deal and then he blows
A crackhead rehabin', workin' again
Ten year bid finished, first day out the pen'
Or a young woman datin' thinkin' love is just pretend
Years later she's all in it and married her best friend
Doctors say she may never conceive
It felt just like Heaven when she had her first seed
Sorta like the opposite of Adam and Eve
See, they ain't recognize Eden till they had to up and leave
But you gotta open your eyes and really see
Heaven might be right in front of you
Stevie breathe on 'em man

Clams Casino. Let's do it again. I'm not gonna just bring y'all down man. No. I know we talk about the chills, but I'm gonna bring that heat

[Verse One]:
I flow so hard independents wanna sign me
But I don't let that define me
I'm too busy getting cheese, making other O.G. MC's rewind me
Flow so hard I'm insane
People saying that my shit changed
I used to spit, tell you I'm the shit
How I line the chicks up and get brain
Bars I write now inflict pain
Putting me close to that B.I.G. lane
True, yeah I said it, I'm a living legend like I'm Ready To Die but not Rick James
Running in houses, jumping on couches
Killing these beats when I'm doing my thing
It's like I got two sides
I'll punch the rap game in the motherfucking mouth with a Unity ring
It's like, it's like
I bet I'mma win
Put bread up, yes I'm better than him
I mean you, them (tell 'em again)
I said you, them, anyone in the damn way when I'm going in
I'm slowing it, down
I scare myself
I be rhyming and rapping, grinding with passion
When lines spoken fast I don't hear myself
I'm mean
I'm nice
I dream
I write
No seeds but I give life
Y'all gon' see my money getting right
But I'm in the left lane, yes I'm hype
Fell down two times, came back twice
Tail ain't red but if I get fed
I'll fight we fight we fight and


[Hook]:
I get up, I get up, I get up, I get up
It don't matter when they come at me wrong
Cause if I fall I get up I get up, I get up, I get up
And I don't care when they come for my ground
If I go down I get up, I get up, I get up, I get up
It don't matter when they come at me wrong
Cause if I fall I get up I get up, I get up, I get up
And I don't care when they come for my ground
If I go down I get up

[Verse Two]:
See I told you nothing's impossible
Even when it's improbable
Or somewhat illogical
Obstacles I put hollows through
Losing is mythological
Use the haters, they comical
I be tellin' 'em F you and pay me, sorta like prostitutes
How could you look inside of you
And stop your moves and not go through
What God put you to do on this planet
Damn it, He's watching you
Yup
Some of us stuck in uniform like private school
While the rest are simply waiting like that doctor's room
Chicks stressing over Christian, Lou, and Prada shoes
Praying for some lotto loot
Might as well just cock and shoot yourself if you ain't waking up dreaming
You think the hot pursuit of money gon' bring happiness
Actually, now's the opportune time to just listen fam
Follow me and see these visions it's like Instagram
But not really
Look I strayed from my initial plan
After today I'm cutting out the N word
But for now I'm that nigga


[Hook]:
I get up, I get up, I get up, I get up
It don't matter when they come at me wrong
Cause if I fall I get up I get up, I get up, I get up
And I don't care when they come for my ground
If I go down I get up, I get up, I get up, I get up
It don't matter when they come at me wrong
Cause if I fall I get upm I get up, I get up, I get up
And I don't care when they come for my ground
If I go down I get up

The more that we say we're not afraid of heights
The more we feel like never coming down

With solar satellites
Star crossed for too many years
Til our distance grew twice as wide
And we were caught with the moon in a cosmic compromise

The more that we say we're not afraid of heights
The more we feel like never coming down

We are sure that's just the danger of our song
We set fires but run from nature - oooh!

Waiting in our mouths

Operator, number please, it's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha? This is old Tom Frost
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now Martha please recall
Meet me out for coffee where we'll talk about it all

And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
And I feel so much older now, you're much older, too
How's your husband? And how's your kids? You know that I got married too
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure

Suzanne takes you down
To her place near the river
You can see the boats go by
And you can spend the night forever
And you know she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

[Verse 2]
And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
Yes, and when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, all men will be sailors then
Until the seas free them
But He, Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken and almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone


[Chorus]
And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
'Cause He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you besides the water
She is wearing rags, feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor

Between the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

In a world like today
It's rare to see young mothers like the ones
Who were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory to quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated to those of us who cherish that memory

[Verse 1]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, ""Boy, hurry to Sunday school""
Filled with the Lord of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
(We love you, Sadie)
Place no one above you, sweet Sadie
(Well, well, well)
Living in the past
(Sometimes it seems so funny
No money will turn your life around)


[Verse 2]
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than pappy's old brandy
Always that needed smile, once in awhile
She would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd seem so happy, yeah, yeah
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times, breaking the binds
With just a simple song

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
(Oh darling)

It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip

Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh

Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise

Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes

Running from the nightmare
In the middle of the road
Hell's no place for sleeping
In a world beyond control
Caught in the headlights
Coming after you
When I woke up this morning
I had to do what I gotta do

On the edge of overload

For the kids in the schools
And the teachers are fools
And you just want to break

I said you're close to the edge
And you're pissed at your work
And the boss is just a jerk

From promises to preacher
And nothing is Nietzsche
And I can't stand the church

I have my opinion
And I don't want to win
Now I just have to work
All right!

[Chorus]
I feel the whole world comin'
Down on me
I feel the whole world comin'
Down on me

[Verse 2]
Well, the judge and the jury
They thought they could school me
And teach me the value of thrift


They put me inside on a one-to-five
And I just had to quit
Well, early in the morning
When we are balling
I nearly had a fit

It came to my head
And I just had to sing
Ain't gonna be nobody's bitch

[Chorus]
I feel the whole world comin'
Down on me
I feel the whole world comin'
Down on me

Comin' down
Down on me
It's comin' down
It's comin down, down, down on me

[Verse 3]
There's only one thing
That I can do now
Go lie in the sun
I want to soak up the rays
And burn myself black
'Cause cancer day has come


And everything you do
To protect yourself
Well, it ain't gonna happen right
You junkie pimps
And mother-fucking whores
Enjoy yourself tonight
All right!

[Chorus]
I feel the whole world comin'
Down on me
