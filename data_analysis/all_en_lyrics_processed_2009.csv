Everything I'd learned I abruptly dropped

And wandered down the road to the open sea

The coldness unfolds over stats and charts
As my love is sold to consuming hearts
And while I prepare words with little meaning
They classify my work for the Western world

My path to the sea is now a dusty street

The lights in the night hide the blues and greens
My mind like a knife cuts the softened things
Oh, where are my eyes? Hiding in the forest
And where is my voice? In the MP3

I'm cold as the stone, you know I can't be glad
And my love is sold, and my soul is sapped
Oh come to the shore where the walkway's broken
Pay tears to the sea, she will be your queen

If you can't hit play cause the button sticks
Ignorance is bliss, I can't say

Sinking fast, the weights chained to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone, a thousand others dropping
Faster than me

Nowhere to brake

Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?

I've got to fall in another direction

The last thing I remember was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open, challenging despair
I don't know what I need, I needed time, I needed to escape
I saw the future turn upside-down and hesitated

He lays his bets on eight more lives and walks into a bar
Slips on the eight ball, falls on his knife, says
""I don't know what I've done, but it doesn't feel right""
Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime
When's the first time you heard that one, 1954?
Get to the punch line, fall to the floor

Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever
I never
I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story
Don't bore me

[Verse 2]
Now I am floating, I feel released
The moorings have been dropped, the weights unleashed
Everything is crystalline, simple and free
The crime of good men who can't wrestle with change
Or are too afraid to face this life's misjudged unknowns
You're not hurting anybody else's chances but you're disfiguring your own

Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever

Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash

Another of this too shall pass

We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call

And god knows what I am

Collect what is mine

Shooting barrels full of fish

Another of this too shall pass

We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late

And god knows what I am

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am...‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖlove the lyrics‚ÄÖso much, I actually wanted to‚ÄÖdo an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)

What kind of dream is this?

[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah

I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

(This is the remix) I want you to stand up and sing no, no, no with us tonight. Come on!
(This is the remix) Naaa, na na na na
(The jeeps pump this new remix) no, no
(This is the remix) let me say hey hey hey hey
(Radios play this remix) no yeah yeah
(This is the remix) no, no
Yeah yeah no no no

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
‚ÄôCause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, ""What's the deal?"", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah


[Bridge]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro]
Bug a boo (talk)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You buggin' me, sing!

[Chorus]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug-a-boo, a bug-a-boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop

[Interlude]
No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through


[Interlude]
And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (boy, say my name)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game (Let me hear you sing)
Say my name, say my name (say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah)
Why the sudden change? (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name  (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you"" (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah yeah)

[Interlude]
They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)
I'm gonna make it (hey?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
Where my survivors at in the house tonight?

[Post-Chorus]

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)


[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Herm√®s Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

If somebody hurts you (Uh)
Even if that somebody was me (Woo, that's hot)
Yeah-hee (Uh, break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (Take 'em outside)
And so I put this on my life (Woo, uh)
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us (Woo, uh, woo)
And I promise I'll give my life (Woo, I'm dancin', woo)
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time)

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row

How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress

But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)

You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it

This is the remix
The jeeps pump this new remix, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
‚ÄôCause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, ""What's the deal?"", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah


[Bridge]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro]
Bug a boo (talk)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You buggin' me, sing!

[Chorus]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug-a-boo, a bug-a-boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop

[Interlude]
No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?

And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game

If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name

Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)

Up in the club (Club), we just broke up (Up)

I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me (Ah)
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity (Infinity) and beyond (And beyond)
Pull me (Pull me in) into your arms (To your arms)
Say I'm the one you want (Ah, I'm the one you want)
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

I know these stars above the ocean
Now new skies call me by name
And suddenly, nothing feels the same
I know the path that must be chosen
But this is bigger than before
Winds have changed, tides turn me far away from shore

Forever far from home
From everything
And everyone I've ever known?

And it's only just begun

If I'm not here to hold her hand
Will she grow to understand?

[Chorus: Auli'i Cravalho & Te Vaka]
I'll go beyond
And although I don't know when
I will reach these sands again

I was a little boy of nine years old
The whole world in my hands
Tryin' to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say, ""I'm sorry""
Every time he had to leave
And I was much to young to understand
When he would say to me

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down, son, come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die

[Verse 2]
I was barely seventeen, summer of seven-nine
Already, I was feelin' like I was runnin' out of time
I had this girl, we fell in love
Should I say that she had me?
Then one fateful night, it changed our lives
And made a memory


[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me, she said
""We've gotta live before we die""
Live before we die

[Post-Chorus]
You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
Live before you die

But I've got not regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

Shout it out, let someone somewhere
Know you're alive
Take these words, wear 'em well

Friends come along but must leave you alone

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am...‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖlove the lyrics‚ÄÖso much, I actually wanted to‚ÄÖdo an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)


[Outro]
What kind of dream is this?

Dangerously in Love 2
[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah


[Chorus]
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(Can't do this thing without you here with me)

Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through


[Interlude]
And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (boy, say my name)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game (Let me hear you sing)
Say my name, say my name (say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah)
Why the sudden change? (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name  (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you"" (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah yeah)
Better say my name

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)
I'm gonna make it (hey?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

Uh-huh, uh, uh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: JAY-Z, Jay-Z & Beyonc√©]
Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyonc√©]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)


[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Herm√®s Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyonc√©]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, talk to 'em, B)


[Bridge: Beyonc√©, JAY-Z & Both]
If I was your girlfriend (Uh, uh, uh-huh)
I'll be there for you (Woo, uh)
If somebody hurts you (Uh)
Even if that somebody was me (Woo, that's hot)
Yeah-hee (Uh, break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (Take 'em outside)
And so I put this on my life (Woo, uh)

Part two
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyonc√©]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret (Oh)
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers

It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)

You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it

This is the remix
The jeeps pump this new remix, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
‚ÄôCause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, ""What's the deal?"", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah


[Bridge]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro]
Bug a boo (talk)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You buggin' me, sing!

[Chorus]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move

I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop

[Interlude]
No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through

And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name

Say my name, say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name

Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me (Ah)
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity (Infinity) and beyond (And beyond)
Pull me (Pull me in) into your arms (To your arms)
Say I'm the one you want (Ah, I'm the one you want)
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

I know these stars above the ocean
Now new skies call me by name
And suddenly, nothing feels the same
I know the path that must be chosen
But this is bigger than before
Winds have changed, tides turn me far away from shore

Forever far from home
From everything
And everyone I've ever known?

And it's only just begun

If I'm not here to hold her hand
Will she grow to understand?

And although I don't know when
I will reach these sands again

I was a little boy of nine years old
The whole world in my hands
Tryin' to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say, ""I'm sorry""
Every time he had to leave
And I was much to young to understand
When he would say to me

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down, son, come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die

[Verse 2]
I was barely seventeen, summer of seven-nine
Already, I was feelin' like I was runnin' out of time
I had this girl, we fell in love
Should I say that she had me?
Then one fateful night, it changed our lives
And made a memory


[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me, she said
""We've gotta live before we die""
Live before we die

[Post-Chorus]
You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
Live before you die

But I've got not regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

Shout it out, let someone somewhere
Know you're alive
Take these words, wear 'em well

I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls

If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call

And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations

You see there's this cat burglar who can't see in the dark
He lays his bets on eight more lives and walks into a bar
Slips on the eight ball, falls on his knife, says
""I don't know what I've done, but it doesn't feel right""
Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime
When's the first time you heard that one, 1954?
Get to the punch line, fall to the floor

[Chorus]
Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever
I never
I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story
Don't bore me

[Verse 2]
Now I am floating, I feel released
The moorings have been dropped, the weights unleashed
Everything is crystalline, simple and free
The crime of good men who can't wrestle with change
Or are too afraid to face this life's misjudged unknowns
You're not hurting anybody else's chances but you're disfiguring your own

[Chorus]
Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever

You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again


It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly

You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again

Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, woke up, brushed my teeth, looked in the mirror, seen my handsome face
I barely couldn't sleep, I'm 'bout to make a hundred grand today (Ah)
Helmut Lang sweats with the splashes
Kiss Asa on the forehead and grab the ratchet
Ferrari Stradale in the garage, Reece Cooper in the lodge
Met my plug at the racetrack, his roof had stars
Dior duffle with two fifty, bought ten, he fronted ten
I sell my shits for thirty-five, I got a template 'bout to hit
Hit my nigga out in Cleveland, he can meet me out in Ar–µs
Said he was gon' bring his cousin, nigga actin' kinda scary
I said, ""Bool"" (Bool), ""Meet me at five, sam–µ place every time""
Somethin' 'bout this time, though, it had a bad vibe
Got there 4:58, hit him up, he said he pullin' in
I hopped out, went to the trunk, and then removed the ten
He got out, talkin' all loud, laughin'
Where his bag? I'm thinkin', then I seen his cousin grabbed it
Somethin' don't feel right
Let me get this three-fifty, then I'm out, I ain't even 'bout to count
Went to grab the gym bag, then I seen the forty flash
Nigga said, ""Give it up"", my heart start beatin' fast
Gave it up, then them niggas sped off in the wagon (Skrrt)
Then I made a call, I need them dead, but they was taxin' (Ah)
I didn't give a fuck, them niggas pussy (Them niggas pussy)
Word is his cousin on the force, but he a rookie
Live in Cleveland Heights, got a wife and three kids, we need the addy (We need the addy)
Make sure we get the ten bricks back, get at me
Two hours later, the fuck nigga got to his house
Put the gym bag down, then he fell on the couch
Thought he hit a good one, then he heard a noise upstairs
Called his wife name, no response, he hopped up out the chair
Went up the staircase, heard his newborn cryin'
Walked in the nursery, then bullets start flyin' (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Wife was tied up, seven hit the nigga, tore his ass up
My nigga jetted down the stairs, grabbed the bag, they was outta there (Skrrt)
Three hours later, got my ten bricks back (Got my ten bricks back)
Kissed Asa on the forehead, good night (Good night)


[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
The rookie cop fam not havin' it, intelligence was hella bent
Once upon a time when the swag was in development
What is kinfolk if two shots ring to see a bag drop?
I speed in SUVs, back wind so
Inchin' up, viewin' what I'm doin', gun crewin'
It was about hundred thou', I returned it since I knew him
Said, ""Fast life, my nigga"", please don't ask 'bout it, Richard
Later on, breaking news, chalk outline a bitch, hurt
A noise outside, see cops all tense
With apprehend, gun flyin' over backyard fence
With a shot to his leg, he damn near bust in my crib
Didn't sight excited, tied it, ""Hide me, hide me""
Boom, boom, boom, ""No, I didn't see any flee from the-""
Check thorough, best lay here 'til tomorrow
Then tweeze out the bullet, so I bandage it, said ""Thank you, Rick""
And once we were far in the trunk of my car
Said, ""Got it from here"", one of his peers, yeah, so I let him out
And now gettin' tortured, askin' questions 'bout his whereabouts

Foes is just bluffin', clear your nose from huff-puffin'
A glutton for bludgeoning blood gushin', here ya go, studmuffin
It‚Äôs nothin', get it on the get-by
Bet it on a dead guy, jetted on the red eye

Dropped these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll
Everybody got one, your mom's is a asshole

Cut it close and catch a slug to the gut bows, word to Thutmose
What's worse, clutch your purse close, lady
We get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, one-eighty

I'm in the cut, looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty like us riding in the whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record, I hate my fuckin' voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing like all that I've been handed
For free, don't pan your cameras to me
Ho, don't command me to speak
Got these little niggas swinging from the banister, on 'Fax in his pajamas
Walking slow because the Camels keep his stamina weak
And you could catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw-jacked right where the catheter peeks‚Äìout

Rapping good as motherfucking janitors sweep now
Getting business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like it's sand on a beach towel

I‚Äôm hiding in the park with all your nieces, trading head for Reese's Pieces
Interjectin' niggas' verses with this book of witches' curses
I cast a spell upon your bitches, but my thirst is for the hearses
I‚Äôm spilling out my innards to these N-words, journey inwards
Caught her quarter past the moment, got a cord of past opponents
In a fragment of a moment, man, I killed that rap then owned it

Drugs, all up in my system
I'm tryna smoke 'em tryna drink 'em, tryna hit some'
No interviews and no meet and greet, can't flick up

I had bitches, I had homies, but they switched up
I'm only kickin' it with your bitch to get my dick sucked
I'm on the road runnin' that dope, I got my stick tucked
Nigga you ain't know talkin' all that shit'll get your shit bust

Ayo (Ah)
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, woke up, brushed my teeth, looked in the mirror, seen my handsome face
I barely couldn't sleep, I'm 'bout to make a hundred grand today (Ah)
Helmut Lang sweats with the splashes
Kiss Asa on the forehead and grab the ratchet
Ferrari Stradale in the garage, Reece Cooper in the lodge
Met my plug at the racetrack, his roof had stars
Dior duffle with two fifty, bought ten, he fronted ten
I sell my shits for thirty-five, I got a template 'bout to hit
Hit my nigga out in Cleveland, he can meet me out in Ar–µs
Said he was gon' bring his cousin, nigga actin' kinda scary
I said, ""Bool"" (Bool), ""Meet me at five, sam–µ place every time""
Somethin' 'bout this time, though, it had a bad vibe
Got there 4:58, hit him up, he said he pullin' in
I hopped out, went to the trunk, and then removed the ten
He got out, talkin' all loud, laughin'
Where his bag? I'm thinkin', then I seen his cousin grabbed it
Somethin' don't feel right
Let me get this three-fifty, then I'm out, I ain't even 'bout to count
Went to grab the gym bag, then I seen the forty flash
Nigga said, ""Give it up"", my heart start beatin' fast
Gave it up, then them niggas sped off in the wagon (Skrrt)
Then I made a call, I need them dead, but they was taxin' (Ah)
I didn't give a fuck, them niggas pussy (Them niggas pussy)
Word is his cousin on the force, but he a rookie
Live in Cleveland Heights, got a wife and three kids, we need the addy (We need the addy)
Make sure we get the ten bricks back, get at me
Two hours later, the fuck nigga got to his house
Put the gym bag down, then he fell on the couch
Thought he hit a good one, then he heard a noise upstairs
Called his wife name, no response, he hopped up out the chair
Went up the staircase, heard his newborn cryin'
Walked in the nursery, then bullets start flyin' (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Wife was tied up, seven hit the nigga, tore his ass up
My nigga jetted down the stairs, grabbed the bag, they was outta there (Skrrt)
Three hours later, got my ten bricks back (Got my ten bricks back)
Kissed Asa on the forehead, good night (Good night)


[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
The rookie cop fam not havin' it, intelligence was hella bent
Once upon a time when the swag was in development
What is kinfolk if two shots ring to see a bag drop?
I speed in SUVs, back wind so
Inchin' up, viewin' what I'm doin', gun crewin'
It was about hundred thou', I returned it since I knew him
Said, ""Fast life, my nigga"", please don't ask 'bout it, Richard
Later on, breaking news, chalk outline a bitch, hurt
A noise outside, see cops all tense
With apprehend, gun flyin' over backyard fence
With a shot to his leg, he damn near bust in my crib
Didn't sight excited, tied it, ""Hide me, hide me""
Boom, boom, boom, ""No, I didn't see any flee from the-""
Check thorough, best lay here 'til tomorrow
Then tweeze out the bullet, so I bandage it, said ""Thank you, Rick""
And once we were far in the trunk of my car
Said, ""Got it from here"", one of his peers, yeah, so I let him out
And now gettin' tortured, askin' questions 'bout his whereabouts

[Outro: Big Pootie & Asa Worthy]

Vik, the wild islander, bringing out the child in ya
Singing out the silencer with more violence than ""Heil Hitler""
He get some looks, some bullshit Bulova, a dusty pullover, and a Pulitzer
A must we bust your crusty subwoofer sister
Foes is just bluffin', clear your nose from huff-puffin'
A glutton for bludgeoning blood gushin', here ya go, studmuffin
It‚Äôs nothin', get it on the get-by
Bet it on a dead guy, jetted on the red eye
Too many make mistake fillers, not enough live wires
Too many fake killers, and jive sires
Dropped these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll
Everybody got one, your mom's is a asshole
S.O.B. and smug to the utmost
Cut it close and catch a slug to the gut bows, word to Thutmose
What's worse, clutch your purse close, lady
We get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, one-eighty

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm in the cut, looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty like us riding in the whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record, I hate my fuckin' voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing like all that I've been handed
For free, don't pan your cameras to me
Ho, don't command me to speak
Got these little niggas swinging from the banister, on 'Fax in his pajamas
Walking slow because the Camels keep his stamina weak
And you could catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw-jacked right where the catheter peeks‚Äìout
Villain, Earl, and Captain in command of your street now
Rapping good as motherfucking janitors sweep now
Getting business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like it's sand on a beach towel

Captain's back (Yay!) So go on put your mic away

I‚Äôm over getting old‚Ä¶

‚ÄòCause I got your picture, I‚Äôm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There‚Äôs a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I‚Äôm the pen


Oh, we were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

Well, if you wanted honesty
That‚Äôs all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go
It‚Äôs better off this way

Today, I‚Äôm on my own
I can‚Äôt move a muscle and I can‚Äôt pick up the phone
I don‚Äôt know (don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt know, don't know)

And now I‚Äôm itching for the tall grass
And longing for the breeze
I need to step outside
Just to see if I can breathe
Got to find the way out
Maybe there‚Äôs a way out

If I could find you now things would get better (oh, oh, oh)
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away, yeah, yeah


I‚Äôm in the business of misery, let‚Äôs take it from the top
She‚Äôs got a body like an hourglass that‚Äôs ticking like a clock
It‚Äôs a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth

But seldom do these words ring true
When I‚Äôm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can‚Äôt break through
Until we disappear
So tell me now

I don‚Äôt want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I‚Äôll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity

But Stacy, can‚Äôt you see
You‚Äôre just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I‚Äôm in love with Stacy‚Äôs mom

I wake up every evening
(I‚Äôm feeling this)
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
(I‚Äôm feeling this)
And you‚Äôre still probably working
(I‚Äôm feeling this)
At a nine-to-five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes


Please tell me why
The car is in the front yard and I‚Äôm
Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you‚Äôre gone, gone

I‚Äôve been let loose and now I‚Äôm crawling up the wall
Word is I got away and now I must be caught
Don‚Äôt leave, take it from me
I‚Äôve been more than a king

Why do we like to hurt so much?
I can‚Äôt decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why, all the possibilities, well I was wrong

Everybody
Put up your hands
Say I don‚Äôt want to be in love
I don‚Äôt want to be in love
Feel the beat now
If you‚Äôve got nothing left
Say I don‚Äôt want to be in love
I don‚Äôt want to be in love

The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes

I don‚Äôt remember one moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, yes, I‚Äôm better not sad
Now I‚Äôm closer to the edge (edge, edge, edge, edge...)

Let‚Äôs leave no words unspoken
And save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

And please don‚Äôt tell me that I‚Äôm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it‚Äôs over
I‚Äôll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

And baby don‚Äôt follow their lead
‚ÄòCause you never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes

A long night spent with your most obvious weakness
You start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
‚ÄòCause you are everything I‚Äôm not

We‚Äôre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I‚Äôll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We‚Äôre going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we‚Äôre going down swinging
I‚Äôll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it",en,"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test, and don‚Äôt ask why It‚Äôs not a question, but a lesson learned in time And that‚Äôs about the time she walked away from me Nobody likes you when you‚Äôre twenty-three And I‚Äôm still more amused by TV shows What the hell is ADD?

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Well, old farmer Johnson, he had troubles of his own
He had an ornery cat just wouldn't leave his home
He tried and he tried to give that cat away
He gave him to a man going far, far away

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Verse 2]
Now, old brother Bill swore he'd kill that cat on sight
He loaded up his gun with rocks and dynamite
He waited, and he waited for that cat to come around
Forty-seven pieces of old Bill was all they found

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
You know the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Spoken]
Groovy
Everybody in the sixties knew that one
I don't remember the sixties
It's not what you think, it's cause he's too old
We're gonna need your help later in this song
We're gonna need you to make a cat noise that sounds like this
Or if you're a soprano, that sounds like this


[Verse 3]
That cat was a possesser of a family of his own
Seven little kittens till there was a cyclone
The house began to shudder, there were buildings all around
Not a single trace of one of those poor little kittens was ever found

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Verse 4]
Know, they gave him to a man going up in a balloon
They told him for to give him to the man on the moon
The balloon got busted, and down it spinned
Fifteen miles up they found that man dead

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Spoken]
I apologize ahead of time for this last verse for the cat lovers in the audience
But if you're feeling queezy at this point, you might want to go over to the side door over there and get your air sickness bags
At the very least, get out your earplugs, your hankys, your night shades
Whatever it takes to get through this last verse
And keep repeating to yourself, ""It's only a song""
The rest of you, think long and hard the next time you're at a fair and your standing in line for one of those Polish sausages


[Verse 5]
Well, they took him to the butcher where that meat was ground
They put him in the hopper when the butcher wasn't round
The cat went in with a blood-curdling scream, meow
Thank you, cat lovers
And the town's meat was furry for more than a week

Aw, baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made, but me, myself?
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
And, uh, what's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)


[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)

It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home


[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted

Turn the lights on

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl


[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh

To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you

With the door closed, we'd be alone

I got a big ego, hahaha, I'm such a big ego, uh-uh-uh
I got a big, eh-eh-eh, ego, she love my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
So stroke my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl
'Cause every thing I throw up, blow up
Talkin' to the girl, she said, ""Know what? Grow up, you nasty,""
I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standin' next to Jay who standin' next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go, my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imaginin'
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego


[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyonc√©]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)

[Verse 3: Beyonc√©]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)


[Chorus: Beyonc√©]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)

But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But I love his big ego, it's too much

[Outro: Beyonc√©]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Well, who's gonna be mine?

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl


[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl


[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say

I got a big ego, hahaha, I'm such a big ego, uh-uh-uh
I got a big, eh-eh-eh, ego, she love my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
So stroke my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl
'Cause every thing I throw up, blow up
Talkin' to the girl, she said, ""Know what? Grow up, you nasty,""
I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standin' next to Jay who standin' next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go, my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imaginin'
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego


[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyonc√©]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)

[Verse 3: Beyonc√©]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)

Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)


[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?


[Chorus]
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain‚Äôt gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain‚Äôt gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar

Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us
Cuz I keep ‚Äòem higher than the bottom of a sky bus
Try some powder sugar pie crumbs
Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you‚Äôse a fine one
I could make your mind numb if you so decided
You don‚Äôt want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it
Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet
Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls
Come get your poison it‚Äôs funner and cheaper than a toy is
You should see my clientele I ain‚Äôt saying names but
I can build a train track everybody‚Äôs buying rails
True fact people at Warner are fuckin‚Äô high as hell
How can you explain putting RYU‚Äôs shit up on the shelf

[Verse 2 Apathy:]
Now here is a story all about how
This old-school shit flips upside-down
See the ‚Äô80s wasn‚Äôt always so shiny and colorful
Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable
When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow
I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow
See they were teenagers misbehavers
Who left little straws, mirrors and razors
You think this shit is fly ain‚Äôt a damn thing funny
Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money
And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams
Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends
All that glitters ain‚Äôt gold I promise
Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office
Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine
I never knew a single soul who owned a rope chain",en,"You see us coming through the door with our hoods up Eyes low sipping on that good stuff And you ain‚Äôt gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar You see us coming through the door with our hoods up Eyes low sipping on that good stuff And you ain‚Äôt gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us Cuz I keep ‚Äòem higher than the bottom of a sky bus Try some powder sugar pie crumbs Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you‚Äôse a fine one I could make your mind numb if you so decided You don‚Äôt want to try it quiet I can make your mind up You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls Come get your poison it‚Äôs funner and cheaper than a toy is You should see my clientele I ain‚Äôt saying names but I can build a train track everybody‚Äôs buying rails True fact people at Warner are fuckin‚Äô high as hell How can you explain putting RYU‚Äôs shit up on the shelf Now here is a story all about how This old-school shit flips upside-down See the ‚Äô80s wasn‚Äôt always so shiny and colorful Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow See they were teenagers misbehavers Who left little straws, mirrors and razors You think this shit is fly ain‚Äôt a damn thing funny Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends All that glitters ain‚Äôt gold I promise Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine I never knew a single soul who owned a rope chain",-0.996286153793335,2009.0,,

I feel good
Even though I shouldn‚Äôt
I‚Äôm chilling so hard couldn‚Äôt tell you where the hood is
I‚Äôm looking like a million bucks
Sucka I‚Äôm sorry
Jeep so clean might as well be a Ferrari
Took off the top like an African safari
Heading to the beach cause I heard the waves are gnarly
No flip flops just a pair of old Barkleys
Got the golden ticket like I took that shit from Charlie
Hardly the day to complain
Ima save that for later
Right now I‚Äôm too busy being lazy as a gator
Even if I seen a hater
Wouldn‚Äôt tell him eat a dick
Cause my shit is hotter than a chicken incubator is
Got a smile on my face
And a roll full of dough
Feeling great cuz I just ate a hot bowl of Pho
Make a stop at the store
Grab a 40 for the road
Who am I kidding make it two and a pack of smokes

[Chorus]
I feel good
And it sounds kinda gangsta
I‚Äôm sorry but I guess it‚Äôs in my nature
Vibrating got the bass all cranked up
Chilling in that ‚Äò85 Samurai, say what


[Verse 2: Apathy]
Man I love these palm trees
They‚Äôre so different from the east
Subwoofers bumping beats
Keep a lookout for police
Cause I‚Äôm still drinking 40s like it‚Äôs 1993
Listening to a cassette of DOC and Diamond D
Got a shirt with a koala and I‚Äôm rocking Wallabees
Follow me
But it‚Äôs kinda hard when I‚Äôm wobbly
'Cause the turntables wobble gotta rock 'em properly
Got 'em from my man who got 'em in a little robbery
And I‚Äôll sell 'em for a G
They‚Äôre ain‚Äôt shit your telling me
'Cause I know it before you say it like I got telepathy
Want to diss before you know me well I know it‚Äôs jealousy
Caught you walking down the street whistling this melody
And I‚Äôm booming
Im booming
Ap is so fly it‚Äôs hard to believe that I‚Äôm human
More like a mutant
Start a revolution
Better start cruising
Before they start shooting

[Refrain]


[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Booming down the block in the drop top
Haters catch a soft spot
'Cause I does it nonstop
You ain‚Äôt got it on lock
Run in to that pawn shop
Try to sell that cheap chain trade it for a small watch
Got the Uzi palmed cocked
Got the posse on deck
You ain‚Äôt puffing like me
We could have a contest
Not to disrespect but I really like your mom's breast
Oops I mean your mom's fresh, I‚Äôm just being honest
It‚Äôs funny all the shit that floats around in my self-concious
I‚Äôm pumping up my ego

Acting like a Chief like I fucked Pocahontas

I said I‚Äôd never hurt you like
All the rest of them jerks do I

Every thing was the truth except for the lies
I just want to apologize
Uh
For the nights I made you cry
Staying up til 5
Like fuck this guy
Waiting by the phone checking the caller I-D
Couldn‚Äôt see it was hurting you inside plus
I was certain that you would never leave my side cuz
Ain‚Äôt nobody closer than you and I was
It looked perfect to the naked eye but
On the surface we were inseparable
On the low I was being too sensual
Put myself in a bad position and I did something that I wish I didn‚Äôt

You don‚Äôt want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it
Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet
Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls
Come get your poison it‚Äôs funner and cheaper than a toy is

I can build a train track everybody‚Äôs buying rails
True fact people at Warner are fuckin‚Äô high as hell
How can you explain putting RYU‚Äôs shit up on the shelf

See the ‚Äô80s wasn‚Äôt always so shiny and colorful
Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable
When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow
I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow
See they were teenagers misbehavers
Who left little straws, mirrors and razors
You think this shit is fly ain‚Äôt a damn thing funny
Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money
And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams
Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends
All that glitters ain‚Äôt gold I promise

Call your pops tell him wire us some money baby
I get a job and I‚Äôll pay him back tomorrow maybe
Not, yea shoot me up take a shot
Share a needle and fuck, this is how we rock yea
I could never stop I could never get enough
Pop another pill, sniff, take another puff
Are we happily in love or is it just lust
The only time we get along is when were getting fucked up
For real, they say we bad for each other
Forget rehab I ain‚Äôt trying to fucking recover
Tell your mother I can quit whenever I choose to
I don‚Äôt need that dumb bitch and that Dr. Drew dude
You can do you, I‚Äôm'a do guess who? Yes me
I can shoot a balloon and make it look it sexy
It‚Äôs a, hard rock life I live it out of focus
Looking for a vein to spike before I‚Äôm dope sick

The pharoah king, hot like heroin
Blowing money arrogant, I‚Äôm so american
We could acquire a range of things
Turn veins and syringes to angel wings
So kids just say ‚Äúno‚Äù or just stick with blow
It took my brother away, the H ate his soul
Kick start his heart, too late he‚Äôs gone
Show him love in a song like I must go on
Fuck around I‚Äôll be chilling down in heroin town
Willimantic CT is where I‚Äôm usually found
Get busy like Debbie Harry, bury your nose in it
Don‚Äôt bother fixing your hair, don‚Äôt worry it goes with it
It seemed like a long shot, but soon as this song drop
You see fiends bringing iPods to pawn shops
Shoot me up I‚Äôm biggie, shoot me up I‚Äôm 50
A needle in the vein to the heart of the city

I feel good
Even though I shouldn‚Äôt
I‚Äôm chilling so hard couldn‚Äôt tell you where the hood is
I‚Äôm looking like a million bucks
Sucka I‚Äôm sorry
Jeep so clean might as well be a Ferrari
Took off the top like an African safari
Heading to the beach cause I heard the waves are gnarly
No flip flops just a pair of old Barkleys
Got the golden ticket like I took that shit from Charlie
Hardly the day to complain
Ima save that for later
Right now I‚Äôm too busy being lazy as a gator
Even if I seen a hater
Wouldn‚Äôt tell him eat a dick
Cause my shit is hotter than a chicken incubator is
Got a smile on my face
And a roll full of dough
Feeling great cuz I just ate a hot bowl of Pho
Make a stop at the store
Grab a 40 for the road
Who am I kidding make it two and a pack of smokes

[Chorus]
I feel good
And it sounds kinda gangsta
I‚Äôm sorry but I guess it‚Äôs in my nature
Vibrating got the bass all cranked up
Chilling in that ‚Äò85 Samurai, say what


[Verse 2: Apathy]
Man I love these palm trees
They‚Äôre so different from the east
Subwoofers bumping beats
Keep a lookout for police
Cause I‚Äôm still drinking 40s like it‚Äôs 1993
Listening to a cassette of DOC and Diamond D
Got a shirt with a koala and I‚Äôm rocking Wallabees
Follow me
But it‚Äôs kinda hard when I‚Äôm wobbly
'Cause the turntables wobble gotta rock 'em properly
Got 'em from my man who got 'em in a little robbery
And I‚Äôll sell 'em for a G
They‚Äôre ain‚Äôt shit your telling me
'Cause I know it before you say it like I got telepathy
Want to diss before you know me well I know it‚Äôs jealousy
Caught you walking down the street whistling this melody
And I‚Äôm booming
Im booming
Ap is so fly it‚Äôs hard to believe that I‚Äôm human
More like a mutant
Start a revolution
Better start cruising
Before they start shooting

[Refrain]


[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Booming down the block in the drop top
Haters catch a soft spot
'Cause I does it nonstop
You ain‚Äôt got it on lock
Run in to that pawn shop
Try to sell that cheap chain trade it for a small watch
Got the Uzi palmed cocked
Got the posse on deck
You ain‚Äôt puffing like me
We could have a contest
Not to disrespect but I really like your mom's breast
Oops I mean your mom's fresh, I‚Äôm just being honest
It‚Äôs funny all the shit that floats around in my self-concious
I‚Äôm pumping up my ego
People say I‚Äôm pompous

I wanna be your David Blaine
Give it to you in a major way
I could be your Flava Flav
Matching grills, I like you braids
You could fill the position
You could be my sexy assistant
When I'm doin the trick
I put you in the mix and then we can all get real explicit
A tisket, a tasket
Girl let me work my magic
Unzip it, your trippin
Like you just took some acid
Its mystic, ethereal
That silky, material
Girl I ain't ever sharing you
Like Lucky Charms cereal
I'm feelin you
I'm fuckin feelin you
I keep it real with you
I hope you feel me too
I mean I'm feelin you
So fuckin feelin you

Hang up the phone, I lay in bed
Your voice is voodoo in my head
Your evil magic casts a spell
You wicked witch I'm trapped in hell
You sign through the air with candles lit
It's powerful I can't handle it
I speak in tongues, I'm so possessed
You stole my soul right from my flesh
This mystical magical hocus pocus
Super-cala-fragilistic-expe-ali-docious

On my radio, only played Easy E

Still sparking the same old flames

I went down south to Dallas
To hear those cowboys wail
Came across that Billy Gibbons
That ol' man ZZ trail
I just can't lose with the Texas blues

Stevie says the sky is crying
Superstitions in his blood

Well, he can run you off the tracks

You get the shivers down your back

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white

No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day

No one to take the blame

They're falling on deaf ears again

They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

[Verse 1]
They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged

""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

[Verse 2]
He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay


He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be


Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Smell of unrest homeward bound
Trails that lay cold and forgotten
Perceive and smell, someone's around
Guised in black hood, myself copied
Raises arm and the truth he narrates
""I am but a shade of your making
Time shall tick and one shall stay""

How am I supposed to untangle
This riddle played in blacks and whites?
One me begs to turn my way around
Another points to a hell bound flight
Inanimate body on the blades of green grass
Orchid smell conquers the rotten
Black hood me wins the battle
The other me is soon forgotten

One truth stands godforsaken
An ode to a silent lover
One hood stays unmistakable
One gets burned, one uncovers

I Seek not peace of mind
Nor counterfeited words of grief
Sorrow's not my godsend present
Another world shall wait for me
Lives are just illusions my friend

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Born is the King of Israel

This by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

All through the year we waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See winter time bringing
The happiest season of all

[Verse 2]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Verse 4]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 5]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
