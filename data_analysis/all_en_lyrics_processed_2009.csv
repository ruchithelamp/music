Everything I'd learned I abruptly dropped

And wandered down the road to the open sea

As my love is sold to consuming hearts
And while I prepare words with little meaning
They classify my work for the Western world

My path to the sea is now a dusty street

The lights in the night hide the blues and greens
My mind like a knife cuts the softened things
Oh, where are my eyes? Hiding in the forest
And where is my voice? In the MP3

I'm cold as the stone, you know I can't be glad
And my love is sold, and my soul is sapped
Oh come to the shore where the walkway's broken
Pay tears to the sea, she will be your queen

And the answer for today is all I got

And I turn you round to face me here

I close my eyes

Whose position shifts cause its been effect
If you can't hit play cause the button sticks
Ignorance is bliss, I can't say

Sinking fast, the weights chained to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone, a thousand others dropping
Faster than me
What put me here? Nothing to hold on to
Nowhere to brake

Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question the choices I make
I've got to fall in another direction

The last thing I remember was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open, challenging despair
I don't know what I need, I needed time, I needed to escape
I saw the future turn upside-down and hesitated

You see there's this cat burglar who can't see in the dark
He lays his bets on eight more lives and walks into a bar
Slips on the eight ball, falls on his knife, says
""I don't know what I've done, but it doesn't feel right""
Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime
When's the first time you heard that one, 1954?
Get to the punch line, fall to the floor

[Chorus]
Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever
I never
I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story
Don't bore me

[Verse 2]
Now I am floating, I feel released
The moorings have been dropped, the weights unleashed
Everything is crystalline, simple and free
The crime of good men who can't wrestle with change
Or are too afraid to face this life's misjudged unknowns
You're not hurting anybody else's chances but you're disfiguring your own

[Chorus]
Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever

I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story

Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call

And god knows what I am

If the storm doesn't kill me, the government will
I've got to get that out of my head

Collect what is mine
Make the best of what today has

Laredo's a beautiful place
Galveston sings like that song that I loved
Its meaning has not been erased

And so there are things that are gone

Another of this too shall pass

We're living our lives, we're here on the fly

And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all

Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)

And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am... I love the lyrics so much, I actually wanted to do an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)


[Outro]
What kind of dream is this?

Dangerously in Love 2
[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah


[Chorus]
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(Can't do this thing without you here with me)

Stay with me, and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave 'cause I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear you calling out my name—I feel no shame

Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way


[Bridge]
There's no stronger love in this world—oh, baby, no

I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are gettin' tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?

And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, lookin' for mine

Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)

The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through


[Interlude]
And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (boy, say my name)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game (Let me hear you sing)
Say my name, say my name (say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah)
Why the sudden change? (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name  (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you"" (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah yeah)
Better say my name

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)

Uh-huh, uh, uh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: JAY-Z, Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)


[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, talk to 'em, B)


[Bridge: Beyoncé, JAY-Z & Both]
If I was your girlfriend (Uh, uh, uh-huh)
I'll be there for you (Woo, uh)
If somebody hurts you (Uh)
Even if that somebody was me (Woo, that's hot)
Yeah-hee (Uh, break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (Take 'em outside)

Yes (Woo, ow)
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B (Yes, woo)
It's your boy, Young
You ready?

[Refrain: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Ch-yeah
History in the making
Part two
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can


[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can


[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

Got me looking so crazy in love (Ch-yeah)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Woo)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No, no)
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (No, no, no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies, man, you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing, though
I sling, though, if anything, I bling, yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret (Oh)
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
The game's been a wrap, one


[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And, baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees

Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)

And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Call up that chick and see if she's home

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am... I love the lyrics so much, I actually wanted to do an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)

What kind of dream is this?

I love you

Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah

I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home


[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are gettin' tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, lookin' for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
'Cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drownin'

And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)

This is the remix
The jeeps pump this new remix, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
’Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, ""What's the deal?"", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah


[Bridge]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro]
Bug a boo (talk)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You buggin' me, sing!

[Chorus]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug-a-boo, a bug-a-boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop

[Interlude]
No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)
I'm gonna make it (hey?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)

E mafai he mafai e

I know these stars above the ocean
Now new skies call me by name
And suddenly, nothing feels the same
I know the path that must be chosen
But this is bigger than before
Winds have changed, tides turn me far away from shore

What waits for me
Forever far from home
From everything

Leaving all I love behind
With the future of our people still to find (E mafai he mafai e, ake ake)

There is destiny in motion
And it's only just begun
Now will this life I’ve worked so hard for come undone?

They're calling me
I must reply
But if I leave
How could I ever say goodbye?

On the vast, uncharted sea?

Can I go beyond?

[Bridge: Auli'i Cravalho]
If I'm not here to hold her hand
Will she grow to understand?

[Chorus: Auli'i Cravalho & Te Vaka]
I'll go beyond
And although I don't know when
I will reach these sands again

I was a little boy of nine years old
The whole world in my hands
Tryin' to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say, ""I'm sorry""
Every time he had to leave
And I was much to young to understand
When he would say to me

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down, son, come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die

[Verse 2]
I was barely seventeen, summer of seven-nine
Already, I was feelin' like I was runnin' out of time
I had this girl, we fell in love
Should I say that she had me?
Then one fateful night, it changed our lives
And made a memory


[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me, she said
""We've gotta live before we die""
Live before we die

[Post-Chorus]
You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
Live before you die

[Bridge]
I made mistakes, I caught some breaks
But I've got not regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
One day you're gonna have to say hello to goodbye
Shout it out, let someone somewhere
Know you're alive
Take these words, wear 'em well
Live before you die
Live before you die
Hey
Live before you die

Friends come along but must leave you alone

I am forward moving river, I am sky on cloudless day
I am ocean large mysterious, I am eyes searching
I am calm and endless blue
Have you heard the words I'm saying
Have you listened to your heart
Know that within the stillness
Nothing can pull us apart
It is love I'm conveying oh mother of light
When you fear that there is nothing
I am the only thing in sight

I am roses still outside
I am love always going, I am red wine

All the cries that you have sent me
All the tears that you have shed
I will gather all together
Turn to gold what once was lead
Heavy burden on your shoulder
Too many thoughts inside your head
All will be as light as feathers
Bring to life what once was dead

In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am... I love the lyrics so much, I actually wanted to do an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)

What kind of dream is this?

Dangerously in Love 2
[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah


[Chorus]
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(Can't do this thing without you here with me)

Just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

With all my heart, I love you, baby
Stay with me, and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave 'cause I believe

[Chorus]
In this love, sweet love
Hear you calling out my name—I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way


[Bridge]
There's no stronger love in this world—oh, baby, no
You're my man, I'm your girl—Oh baby no
Wait and see, this can't be wrong
Don't you know this is where you belong?

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man

You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

Satellites
Flashin' by

[Verse 1]
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side

In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashin' by
Like satellites

Ooh, ooh
Oh, I know it ain't the same

[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now, everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over (Ooh)
The way you hurt me (Ooh)
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no (Mean a thing)
The very thing you gave to me (Ooh)
I thought I could forgive you (Ooh)
And I know you've changed (Ooh)
As much as I wanna trust you (Ooh)
I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied


[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Hard time, ooh)

But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why (Why)
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I (Ooh)
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this, ooh)

I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could (Ooh)
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time (Time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment


[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', ""What's up with B?""

I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you (Ah)

But I'm out of control (Ah)

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
I'm seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it (Ah)

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)

Baby, can you handle this?

I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor

Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)
I'm gonna make it (hey?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon’ work harder
I will survive
I will survive
You will survive

They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question Independent Women Part I Lucy Liu With my girl Drew Cameron D. and Destiny And then there we three Question, tell me what you think about me I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely When it's all over, please get up and leave Question, tell me how you feel about this Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills Always fifty-fifty in relationships The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em) The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em) The rock I'm rocking (I bought it) 'Cause I depend on me if I want it The watch I'm wearing (I bought it) The house I live in (I bought it) The car I'm driving (I bought it) I depend on me, I depend on me All the women who're independent Throw your hands up at me All the honeys who makin' money Throw your hands up at me All the mamas who profit dollars Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up) All the ladies that truly feel me Throw your hands up at me (Come on) It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary Bootylicious Kelly, can you handle this? Michelle, can you handle this? Beyonce, can you handle this? I don't think they can handle this (Woo) I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this 'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey) I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe) I don't think you're ready for this 'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe Baby, can you handle this? Baby, can you handle this? Baby, can you handle this? I don't think you can handle this (Woo) With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight Survivor Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin' You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

If somebody hurts you (Uh)
Even if that somebody was me (Woo, that's hot)

Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (Take 'em outside)
And so I put this on my life (Woo, uh)
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us (Woo, uh, woo)

Part two
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)

Got me looking so crazy in love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can


[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Ch-yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Ch-yeah)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Woo)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (No, no, no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies, man, you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing, though
I sling, though, if anything, I bling, yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret (Oh)
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no)
The game's been a wrap, one

This next song is actually an up-tempo song of off my new record I am... I love the lyrics so much, I actually wanted to do an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, it's almost too good to be true. You don't know if it's a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
(You can be a sweet dream) or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Wake up from you, you

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)
Tattoo your name across my heart (Tattoo your name across my heart)
Not even death can do us part (Not even death can do us part)


[Outro]
What kind of dream is this?

I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me

My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
Yeah yeah

I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are gettin' tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, lookin' for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
'Cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drownin'
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream

[Intro (part 2)]
(Remix)
This is the remix
The jeeps pump this new remix, uh-huh
This is the remix
Radios play this remix

[Interlude]
(This is the remix) I want you to stand up and sing no, no, no with us tonight. Come on!
(This is the remix) Naaa, na na na na
(The jeeps pump this new remix) no, no
(This is the remix) let me say hey hey hey hey
(Radios play this remix) no yeah yeah
(This is the remix) no, no
Yeah yeah no no no

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
’Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, ""What's the deal?"", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah


[Bridge]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro]
Bug a boo (talk)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You buggin' me, sing!

[Chorus]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug-a-boo, a bug-a-boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop

[Interlude]
No, no, no and Bug a Boo became number one records, and the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together

Bills, bills, bills
[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (So what?)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through


[Interlude]
And then there were two. And then there were four

Say My Name
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why? Why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game, while you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (boy, say my name)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game (Let me hear you sing)
Say my name, say my name (say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah)
Why the sudden change? (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name  (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you"" (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby"" (yeah yeah)
Better say my name

[Interlude]
They called us male bashes. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song, independent women. I went into the studio, all by myself and I recorded a demo, because I wanted to make it very very clear that we payed our own bills. here comes my father again. He snugged the demo, and he took it to Sony Pictures, to submit for the soundtrack ""Charlies Angels"". Now why did he do that? Question. Well the song ended up being number one for twelve weeks in a row. So he ended up doing the right thing. Question

Independent Women Part I
[Intro]
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
And then there we three

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
The shoes on my feet (I bought 'em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

[Chorus]
All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up)
All the ladies that truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me (Come on)

[Interlude]
It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptuous woman. I might have been full of that [?] haha. Hell I might have been full from all the food I've been eating, haha. But I said I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a womans curves. And no matter what they said about me, I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in the dictionary

Bootylicious
[Intro]
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Chorus]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (babe)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Interlude]
With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity. And this last song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying Destiny's Child was like the reality television show Survivor. Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio, pick up my paper and my pen and write us out of all that negativity. The result. Have you survived sexism, racism and illness? Have you survived just a hater? Put your fist up and sing with me tonight

Survivor
[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what?

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor (Survivor hey)
I'm gonna make it (hey?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up (What?)
I'm not gon' stop (What?)
I'm gon' work harder (What?)
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm gonna make it (What?)
I will survive (What?)
Keep on survivin' (What?)
Where my survivors at in the house tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon’ work harder
I will survive
I will survive
You will survive

E mafai he mafai e
Olo ake ake

[Verse 1: Auli'i Cravalho]
I know these stars above the ocean
Now new skies call me by name
And suddenly, nothing feels the same
I know the path that must be chosen
But this is bigger than before
Winds have changed, tides turn me far away from shore

[Pre-Chorus: Auli'i Cravalho]
What waits for me
Forever far from home
From everything
And everyone I've ever known?

Under skies I’ve nеver seen?
Will I lose myself between (E mafai he mafai e)

If I go beyond (E mafai he mafai e)
Leaving all I love behind
With the future of our people still to find (E mafai he mafai e, ake ake)
Can I go beyond?


[Verse 2: Auli'i Cravalho]
There is destiny in motion
And it's only just begun
Now will this life I’ve worked so hard for come undone?

[Pre-Chorus: Auli'i Cravalho]
They're calling me
I must reply
But if I leave
How could I ever say goodbye?

On the vast, uncharted sea?

And what's out there beyond? (E mafai he mafai e)
Leaving all I love behind
With the future of our people still to find (E mafai he mafai e, ake ake)
Can I go beyond?

[Bridge: Auli'i Cravalho]
If I'm not here to hold her hand
Will she grow to understand?

[Chorus: Auli'i Cravalho & Te Vaka]
I'll go beyond
And although I don't know when
I will reach these sands again
'Cause I know who I am (Ake ake)

Of the land and of the sea (Olo ake ake)

I was a little boy of nine years old
The whole world in my hands
Tryin' to toss that ball across the yard
A game of catch with my old man
He would always say, ""I'm sorry""
Every time he had to leave
And I was much to young to understand
When he would say to me

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
Sit down, son, come take my hand
Look me in the eye
Take these words, promise me
You'll live before you die

[Verse 2]
I was barely seventeen, summer of seven-nine
Already, I was feelin' like I was runnin' out of time
I had this girl, we fell in love
Should I say that she had me?
Then one fateful night, it changed our lives
And made a memory


[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
There'll come a day
You'll have to say hello to goodbye
She laid me down, she took my hand
Looked me in the eye
And just before she kissed me, she said
""We've gotta live before we die""
Live before we die

[Post-Chorus]
You learn to love, to live
You fight and you forgive
You learn what's wrong and right
Live before you die

[Bridge]
I made mistakes, I caught some breaks
But I've got not regrets
There's some things I don't remember
But one thing I don't forget

[Chorus]
When you're young you always think
The sun is gonna shine
One day you're gonna have to say hello to goodbye
Shout it out, let someone somewhere
Know you're alive
Take these words, wear 'em well
Live before you die
Live before you die
Hey
Live before you die

Unbelievable, the gospel according to who?
I lay right down

Choking on the bones you toss to them

History will set me free

You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again

You see there's this cat burglar who can't see in the dark
He lays his bets on eight more lives and walks into a bar
Slips on the eight ball, falls on his knife, says
""I don't know what I've done, but it doesn't feel right""
Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime
When's the first time you heard that one, 1954?
Get to the punch line, fall to the floor

Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for the worst joke ever
I never
I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story
Don't bore me

[Verse 2]
Now I am floating, I feel released
The moorings have been dropped, the weights unleashed
Everything is crystalline, simple and free

I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world

'Cause if heaven does exist
With a kickin' playlist
I don't wanna miss it at the end of the world

Hey, steady steady

But ""I'll spin my way right through it""
Claims enthusiast Jack Pruitt
As the moths circle the moon
As you're circling the room


The music could provide the light
You cannot resist
You cannot resist
You cannot resist

And the weblogs that get tangled
As you willie and you wangle
In your walk-up in Seattle
Where you fought the nascent battle
And you threw the thread and throttle
Let us raise another bottle
Raise another bottle
Raise another bottle

Because death is pretty final

You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again


It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside

You always had a way with words
I'm in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am the first
If I asked of you for just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth?
You're off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured out that if you must serve me up
Another of this too shall pass

It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
We're living our lives, we're here on the fly
It's easy to laugh off, easy to brush aside
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I've been exclusive when it comes to you
I don't recieve at all
I wish I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you wouldn't call
God knows what I'm looking for
And god knows what I am
Cause even Jesus had his reservations
I won't be doubting you again
I won't be doubting you again

Unbelievable, the gospel according to who?

Don't turn your talking points on me
History will set me free

You disappear mid-sentence
In a judgement crisis, I see my in and go for it

Ayo (Ah)
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, woke up, brushed my teeth, looked in the mirror, seen my handsome face
I barely couldn't sleep, I'm 'bout to make a hundred grand today (Ah)
Helmut Lang sweats with the splashes
Kiss Asa on the forehead and grab the ratchet
Ferrari Stradale in the garage, Reece Cooper in the lodge
Met my plug at the racetrack, his roof had stars
Dior duffle with two fifty, bought ten, he fronted ten
I sell my shits for thirty-five, I got a template 'bout to hit
Hit my nigga out in Cleveland, he can meet me out in Arеs
Said he was gon' bring his cousin, nigga actin' kinda scary
I said, ""Bool"" (Bool), ""Meet me at five, samе place every time""
Somethin' 'bout this time, though, it had a bad vibe
Got there 4:58, hit him up, he said he pullin' in
I hopped out, went to the trunk, and then removed the ten
He got out, talkin' all loud, laughin'
Where his bag? I'm thinkin', then I seen his cousin grabbed it
Somethin' don't feel right
Let me get this three-fifty, then I'm out, I ain't even 'bout to count
Went to grab the gym bag, then I seen the forty flash
Nigga said, ""Give it up"", my heart start beatin' fast
Gave it up, then them niggas sped off in the wagon (Skrrt)
Then I made a call, I need them dead, but they was taxin' (Ah)
I didn't give a fuck, them niggas pussy (Them niggas pussy)
Word is his cousin on the force, but he a rookie
Live in Cleveland Heights, got a wife and three kids, we need the addy (We need the addy)
Make sure we get the ten bricks back, get at me
Two hours later, the fuck nigga got to his house
Put the gym bag down, then he fell on the couch
Thought he hit a good one, then he heard a noise upstairs
Called his wife name, no response, he hopped up out the chair
Went up the staircase, heard his newborn cryin'
Walked in the nursery, then bullets start flyin' (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Wife was tied up, seven hit the nigga, tore his ass up
My nigga jetted down the stairs, grabbed the bag, they was outta there (Skrrt)
Three hours later, got my ten bricks back (Got my ten bricks back)
Kissed Asa on the forehead, good night (Good night)


[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
The rookie cop fam not havin' it, intelligence was hella bent
Once upon a time when the swag was in development
What is kinfolk if two shots ring to see a bag drop?
I speed in SUVs, back wind so
Inchin' up, viewin' what I'm doin', gun crewin'
It was about hundred thou', I returned it since I knew him
Said, ""Fast life, my nigga"", please don't ask 'bout it, Richard
Later on, breaking news, chalk outline a bitch, hurt
A noise outside, see cops all tense
With apprehend, gun flyin' over backyard fence
With a shot to his leg, he damn near bust in my crib
Didn't sight excited, tied it, ""Hide me, hide me""
Boom, boom, boom, ""No, I didn't see any flee from the-""
Check thorough, best lay here 'til tomorrow
Then tweeze out the bullet, so I bandage it, said ""Thank you, Rick""
And once we were far in the trunk of my car
Said, ""Got it from here"", one of his peers, yeah, so I let him out
And now gettin' tortured, askin' questions 'bout his whereabouts

I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing like all that I've been handed

Ayo (Ah)
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, woke up, brushed my teeth, looked in the mirror, seen my handsome face
I barely couldn't sleep, I'm 'bout to make a hundred grand today (Ah)
Helmut Lang sweats with the splashes
Kiss Asa on the forehead and grab the ratchet
Ferrari Stradale in the garage, Reece Cooper in the lodge
Met my plug at the racetrack, his roof had stars
Dior duffle with two fifty, bought ten, he fronted ten
I sell my shits for thirty-five, I got a template 'bout to hit
Hit my nigga out in Cleveland, he can meet me out in Arеs
Said he was gon' bring his cousin, nigga actin' kinda scary
I said, ""Bool"" (Bool), ""Meet me at five, samе place every time""
Somethin' 'bout this time, though, it had a bad vibe
Got there 4:58, hit him up, he said he pullin' in
I hopped out, went to the trunk, and then removed the ten
He got out, talkin' all loud, laughin'
Where his bag? I'm thinkin', then I seen his cousin grabbed it
Somethin' don't feel right
Let me get this three-fifty, then I'm out, I ain't even 'bout to count
Went to grab the gym bag, then I seen the forty flash
Nigga said, ""Give it up"", my heart start beatin' fast
Gave it up, then them niggas sped off in the wagon (Skrrt)
Then I made a call, I need them dead, but they was taxin' (Ah)
I didn't give a fuck, them niggas pussy (Them niggas pussy)
Word is his cousin on the force, but he a rookie
Live in Cleveland Heights, got a wife and three kids, we need the addy (We need the addy)
Make sure we get the ten bricks back, get at me
Two hours later, the fuck nigga got to his house
Put the gym bag down, then he fell on the couch
Thought he hit a good one, then he heard a noise upstairs
Called his wife name, no response, he hopped up out the chair
Went up the staircase, heard his newborn cryin'
Walked in the nursery, then bullets start flyin' (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Wife was tied up, seven hit the nigga, tore his ass up
My nigga jetted down the stairs, grabbed the bag, they was outta there (Skrrt)
Three hours later, got my ten bricks back (Got my ten bricks back)
Kissed Asa on the forehead, good night (Good night)


[Verse 2: Slick Rick]
The rookie cop fam not havin' it, intelligence was hella bent
Once upon a time when the swag was in development
What is kinfolk if two shots ring to see a bag drop?
I speed in SUVs, back wind so
Inchin' up, viewin' what I'm doin', gun crewin'
It was about hundred thou', I returned it since I knew him
Said, ""Fast life, my nigga"", please don't ask 'bout it, Richard
Later on, breaking news, chalk outline a bitch, hurt
A noise outside, see cops all tense
With apprehend, gun flyin' over backyard fence
With a shot to his leg, he damn near bust in my crib
Didn't sight excited, tied it, ""Hide me, hide me""
Boom, boom, boom, ""No, I didn't see any flee from the-""
Check thorough, best lay here 'til tomorrow
Then tweeze out the bullet, so I bandage it, said ""Thank you, Rick""
And once we were far in the trunk of my car
Said, ""Got it from here"", one of his peers, yeah, so I let him out
And now gettin' tortured, askin' questions 'bout his whereabouts

[Outro: Big Pootie & Asa Worthy]
Asa, can you say ""Daddy""?

Vik, the wild islander, bringing out the child in ya
Singing out the silencer with more violence than ""Heil Hitler""
He get some looks, some bullshit Bulova, a dusty pullover, and a Pulitzer
A must we bust your crusty subwoofer sister
Foes is just bluffin', clear your nose from huff-puffin'
A glutton for bludgeoning blood gushin', here ya go, studmuffin
It’s nothin', get it on the get-by
Bet it on a dead guy, jetted on the red eye
Too many make mistake fillers, not enough live wires
Too many fake killers, and jive sires
Dropped these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll
Everybody got one, your mom's is a asshole
S.O.B. and smug to the utmost
Cut it close and catch a slug to the gut bows, word to Thutmose
What's worse, clutch your purse close, lady
We get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, one-eighty

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm in the cut, looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty like us riding in the whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record, I hate my fuckin' voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing like all that I've been handed
For free, don't pan your cameras to me
Ho, don't command me to speak
Got these little niggas swinging from the banister, on 'Fax in his pajamas
Walking slow because the Camels keep his stamina weak
And you could catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw-jacked right where the catheter peeks–out
Villain, Earl, and Captain in command of your street now
Rapping good as motherfucking janitors sweep now
Getting business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like it's sand on a beach towel


[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
Captain's back (Yay!) So go on put your mic away
(Where?) Inside a microwave (Oh.)
When I die, I bet you Mike'll wave (Hee-hee)
We blowing bubbles at the Pearly Gates
Took a selfie with the king but only see my face
I’m writing darker pieces in my thesis
I’m hiding in the park with all your nieces, trading head for Reese's Pieces
Interjectin' niggas' verses with this book of witches' curses
I cast a spell upon your bitches, but my thirst is for the hearses
I’m spilling out my innards to these N-words, journey inwards
Caught her quarter past the moment, got a cord of past opponents
In a fragment of a moment, man, I killed that rap then owned it
Hope to overtake the planet, with my banana in a hammock
Bitch manic, parents panic, I’m a mechanic with these patterns
Propagandic with that chatter, matter of fact the Madder Hatter
Never mind the hammer, manners out the window, pump crescendo
Puff the endo, I’m Lou Ferrigno, just pretendo
Don’t ask him where the pen go
'Cause the pencil got me paper paid and paydirt made the pain hurt
With the Mask and faded Sweatshirt – nothing lesser
Bet you’ll never ever guess what I left under the dresser

Drugs, all up in my system
I'm tryna smoke 'em tryna drink 'em, tryna hit some'
No interviews and no meet and greet, can't flick up
To you rap niggas, don't say my name when you spit somethin'
I had bitches, I had homies, but they switched up
I'm only kickin' it with your bitch to get my dick sucked
I'm on the road runnin' that dope, I got my stick tucked
Nigga you ain't know talkin' all that shit'll get your shit bust
I got that fire on me right now, nigga I slay shit
Before I leave the house I thank God and I pray, bitch

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don’t ask why
It’s not a question, but a lesson learned in time

And that’s about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you’re twenty-three
And I’m still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What’s my age again?

Check yes, Juliet
(What’s my age again?)
Are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won’t go until you come outside

(Can I graduatе!?)

If I could just find the time
Then I would nеver let another day go by
I’m over getting old…

‘Cause I got your picture, I’m coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There’s a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I’m the pen


Oh, we were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

Well, if you wanted honesty
That’s all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go
It’s better off this way

Today, I’m on my own
I can’t move a muscle and I can’t pick up the phone
I don’t know (don’t know, don’t know, don't know)

And now I’m itching for the tall grass
And longing for the breeze
I need to step outside
Just to see if I can breathe
Got to find the way out
Maybe there’s a way out

If I could find you now things would get better (oh, oh, oh)
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away, yeah, yeah


I’m in the business of misery, let’s take it from the top
She’s got a body like an hourglass that’s ticking like a clock
It’s a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth

But seldom do these words ring true
When I’m constantly failing you
Walls that we just can’t break through
Until we disappear
So tell me now

I don’t want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I’ll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity

But Stacy, can’t you see
You’re just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I’m in love with Stacy’s mom

I wake up every evening
(I’m feeling this)
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
(I’m feeling this)
And you’re still probably working
(I’m feeling this)
At a nine-to-five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes


Please tell me why
The car is in the front yard and I’m
Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you’re gone, gone

I’ve been let loose and now I’m crawling up the wall
Word is I got away and now I must be caught
Don’t leave, take it from me
I’ve been more than a king

Why do we like to hurt so much?
I can’t decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why, all the possibilities, well I was wrong

Everybody
Put up your hands
Say I don’t want to be in love
I don’t want to be in love
Feel the beat now
If you’ve got nothing left
Say I don’t want to be in love
I don’t want to be in love

The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes

I don’t remember one moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, yes, I’m better not sad
Now I’m closer to the edge (edge, edge, edge, edge...)

Let’s leave no words unspoken
And save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

And please don’t tell me that I’m dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it’s over
I’ll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

And baby don’t follow their lead
‘Cause you never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes

A long night spent with your most obvious weakness
You start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
‘Cause you are everything I’m not

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Rich or poverty
어디 어떻게 사는진 아무 신경 쓸 겨를 없이
어디든 I brought my mic with me
Opposite of fake, 느낄 수 밖에
내 질이 다른지는 말로 할게 아니지
Hip-hop 나의 prophecy
누구는 정치 가득
또 누구는 싸우기 바쁜 시대
숨 가쁜 리듬들 내 삶은 아니기에
다시 지금이 다른 beat, 다른 시도
다른 시공간에서 나는 믿지 나와 나 내 안의 신

[Verse 2: Leo Kekoa]
Hip-hop이라는 map 속에 decade of rap
보여줬지 계속해서 guess I’m taking it back
나와 beat를 합친다고, we like Kobe and Shaq
수비 따윈 하지 않아, you know so we attack
From written to freestyle, 서울 to Vista
I dribble dribble the rap like Zinedine Zidane
난 신화 like Titan, mic 잡은 Tyson
이 rap game에 끝판, 마치 Street Fighter Bison

[Verse 3: JUSTHIS]
Yeah, 유행할 때는 지도 다 했지
불리할 때는 지도 한마디 안 했지
근데 간 보다 여론 유리해질 때 쓱 뱉는 거 10년째지
That pussy ass shit
나도 그중 한 명에서 이제 돈이 내 main thing
Hip-hop 이제 다른 의미로 save me
Hip-hop은 Ponyromo, Big Baby지
이건 걍 수익기부 한대서 했지
넌 아직 죽기 살기로 더 살 때지
난 살기로 하고 죽여 when I'm rappin'
I made it with my record clean mo' fucker
Wanna talk then first you gotta pay me
I went from the favorite to the most hated
And no one can replace me
This industry gotta face THIS, ugh


[Verse 4: Royal 44]
Ahh, yeah, Royal, ha
I got a beautiful bitch
I fucked a beautiful bitch (Okay)
Uh, yeah, ha
Yeah, 그녀와 하고 난 뒤
She say ""Royal은 Top G"" (Okay)
Hip-hop에 대해서 쓰래
난 돈밖에 모르는데 어떡해 (Okay)
벌써 억을 넘게 썼지만
Royal은 아직도 만족 못해 (Okay)
입어 난 또 Christian Dior
그녀는 내 위에서 하지 아이키도
매일 밤 놓여 난 선택의 기로
여자들 불러 나의 studio에

[Verse 5: PENOMECO]
그늘 따윈 없어, while the sun goes down
Walk up in the city, we just run this town
손을 들어, 하늘이 다 덮이게
새 scene은 눈앞에, 두 발은 이 거리에
What goes around
틀림없이 다시 comes around
My legacy, oh
내일을 더 바라보게 되겠지, oh
Now let me see
You just come and see me


[Verse 6: Khakii]
You always 힘을 줘
도저히 못 할 일 덕에 해냈어
Whenever I feel bad, you be ma badass
누가 뭐래도 K-hip-hop 내 애비여
혹은 내 선생, 또 family (Aye)
삶을 배웠지, 그래 꽤나 빡센 형과 shit
나 같은 놈들 여기 모여 party 해 (Aye)
It’s 50 years, 쉽진 않았기에 눈물 날 밤이네 (Okay)
Still 혼자일 땐 with DT and Double D
춤을 추곤 하기에 (Okay)
태돌 지켜 걸어가지

[Verse 7: Ahn Byeong Woong]
Look, 돈 벌더라도 태돈 지켜 (Uh-huh)
쉽게 손 닿을 곳엔 관심 없어
So ambitious, I got my own vision
So I don't give a fuck 'bout your opinion
멋대로인 건 변명이 듣고 자란 Beenzino (Whoa)
처음 들었던 곡은 '멀어'부터
Joey Bada$$ to Biggie Smalls 'Machine Gun Funk'
또 A men의 break loop까지 건너 like I’m a tourist (Tourist)
이젠 Run D.M.C, check 해봐, Adidas on me

[Verse 8: Roh Yunha]
South Korean 서울, 광주, 일산
다시 I'm back, 맨날 rap shit
될지 안 될지 아무도 몰랐지만 필요 없던 plan B
아픈 기억의 시작이었던 일산 이제는 reppin' my city
You feel me, 느낌이 왔고 2016 그때였지
Linchpin in my heart
좁은 시야, why you blurr
일단 까고 보는 대중들 덕에
More big steppin' dream large
다들 원하잖아 star
9월 말쯤에 나타날 걸
아직도 못 막아
20 again, 나 어리기에 막 나가 (Let's go)


[Verse 9: Paloalto]
이건 지키는 game
버티러 온 게 아니야, 불을 지피지 매일
시기심 땜에, 혹은 경쟁이 과해서 시끄럽네
Glory and pains (Huh)
두 개 다 겪어야 결국엔 이기지
여긴 내 집이지
내 인생 책임질 밥벌이 동시에 예술인 셈이지, uh
먼저 길을 걸었던 선구자들에게 경례 (Yessir)
그들이 했던 것처럼 나 역시 여기서 보여준 선례
여전히 설레, ball till I fall, 위대한 flowin' (Whoo)
I don't rap I'm just livin', 내 존재는 golden (Ya heard?)

[Verse 10: Owen]
They all claiming who the greatest?
이건 race, you never know
Divided in 21st century
맞댄 머리, 잡은 손
Way we should flow
우리의 끝판 boss는 다름 아닌 돈
중지 척 to 자본주의
They don't care our rise and falls
So I'm back on track, killing idiotics
Can't abuse some narcotics
무의미한 다툼, 위해, 자리
견디고 앉아 방석, 가시
인내 후 맞이 개화기
봉우리에 만발 장미
더는 당하지 않아 사기
신념 vs 사업가 방식

[Verse 11: Nucksal]
모두가 제대로 살려고 발버둥도
안 쳐본 놈과는 말도 안 섞음
갈증이나 원액을 한 모금
실증이나 섞고 섞이는
맞고 틀렸대, 아까는 맞았고
그래, 하려던 말을 난 말았고
보고 있어, 언제 니 혀를 뽑을지
불을 붙이지 마라 내 화약고
바락바락 또 열 내
Hip-hop이 어쩌네
돈이 될 땐 다 형제
뒤에선 찌르고 걸었겠지 역배
진짜 필요해 사랑의 열매
진짜 불필요해 가짜 연기에
50년짜리 판에 남은 이는 누구?
지금은 술을 붓는 moment

[Verse 12: SINCE]
누군가 맺은 열매 보고서 느끼는 뿌리가 motivation
바닥에 있던 내게 위로 가는 길을 제시해준 navigation
경쟁에서 살아남는 것
더 나은 삶을 또 살아가는 법
깨우친 뒤에 한 개씩 깨는 벽
동경했던 모습 거울 속에 있어
충대 도서관에서 무대 위 오르기까지
묵묵히 걸었지 내 길로
같은 곳, 다른 기분 느껴
Hip-hop이 바꿔놓은 거지 내 이름과 진로
꿈이 현실로
혼자 눌러 쓴 가사들이 보여준 기적
누가 날 믿던 안 믿던
그딴 건 상관없는 이유가 바로 여깄어

[Verse 13: BLASE]
We on the race
난 매일 내일의 날 빌려
사소한 일들은 늘 밀려
그래 늘 인간관계는 비겁
마주해 세상을 on speaker
일반적 상황을 늘 비켜 가
They wanna fight
전엔 피했지만 이제는 난 지켜
On the race but no rules
걍 내가 멋있으면 끝
한국 hip-hop 탓이나 해 너흰
난 자연스레 걍 빠지고
개꿀이지, lotta fool
정산대로 우린 나뉠 뿐, uh
Reset our vision, we'll never lose, uh

[Verse 14: Skinny Brown]
Uh, Young Money turn to old money, see what it is
Trukfit에서 다음은 opuim fit, Balenci rock that rick
난 기억해, 어릴 적 내 어머닌 다섯 명이었지
Now we make sense, 약이 없이 못 자는 이유
Man, I was sentenced to die in the middle
Hip-hop이 완성해 내 sentence
I'm all about rhythm
I'm all about 지금
과거와 미래를 잇는
Think I'm bridge (Yeah)
They think I'm 썅놈
허나 주위를 see
신 놓지 않는 건 나와 몇 썅놈

[Verse 15: Los]
I’m back by God’s demand, 소금 뿌려놔 내 갈 길에
내 873은 카키색 blue fitted, 마치 다저스 팬
넌 말이 많아 like my BM, 우린 담궈버려 빠지에
SNCL, it’s demon time, 잠 못 잔 지 3일째
시작부터 옆에 없었으면 맛도 안 보여줘 내 담뱃재
I’m the shit, yeah, 챙겨와 파리채
아니, 챙겨와 body bag
'Cause I bodied that
우리가 없으면 hip-hop is dead

[Verse 16: Deepflow]
반세기만의 B-Day, 다들 모여 기념해
우린 그 절반의 나이지, 여전히 현재진행
모양은 다 달라도 나눌 수 있는 reminisce
모두의 혀끝엔 있지 가리온의 DNA
규칙은 없다고 이 여덟 마디 옥타곤에
But 글러브를 꼈다가도 링 밖에서는 벗어둬
내 rhyme에 어떤 것도 그 사랑 다 못 담아내
내게 갚을 기회를 준다면 기꺼이 몽땅 꺼내지

[Verse 17: Huh]
Need more fuckin’ drunkness
To not be afraid of dying
죽을 각오로 every time
한 끗 차이, if you sabotage
평화 끝난 지 오래야
You know no money there’s no probs
Hip-hop이 나를 살렸으니까 되갚을 차례 for the culture
난 걸음마 떼자마자 코형의 손에 길러진 애
이걸 다른 말로 불러보니 명문 사립이네
좋은 것만 듣고 자라다 보니 난 좀 이기적이네
내 식구들만이 볼 빛, 걔넨 여전히 빗속이게 해

[Verse 18: Homies (CK, Louie, Chin)]
비참한 놈들이 며칠 전에 샀어 BMW for my dad
나는 덤덤하게 우리 삶을 적어나가네
난 더 감아 내 태엽
난 맨날 다 끝내나 언제나 check my brain, yo
더 줘봐 니 hate, 널 바꾸어줄게
믿어 날, your my fam
우리는 수많은 억까를 이겨내고 빠져 돈 맛에
난 빠져 돈 맛에, 넌 사려 몸 안에
숨기고 넌 평생 갇혀 살아라 그 밑바닥에 평생, uh
우리 뜨면 다 죽어, 존나 superstar여
난 맨날 콘돔 갖고 다녀, 시발 superstar 여
시발 나는 좆대로 해, 존나 superstar여
발자국을 남겨, feel like Amazing Spider
Pussy rapper 삼켜, yeah, I'm so high like pilot
I walk it like I talk it, 써온 대로야, no liar
존나 뜨거 내 rap and life, 인간이 fire, umm

[Verse 19: SUPERBEE]
Yeah, yeah, hunnid-fifty, hunnid-fifty
그 정도만 딱 월에 손에 꽂힘
허린 삘지 몰라도 rap만 하는 삶이 꿈이었고
라면 삼시세끼 먹는대도 몰라 배까란 객긴
날 100억따리로 show the way
I fucked her, ""넌 안될 걸"" 했던 놈의 여동생
I love riches, 저 저 밑에서 blow up, quickly
난 못 믿지 쟤, 이 놈 새끼들 뻥튀긴
시작은 UFO mic, 또 파란색깔 Cool Edit
새꺄, 난 크게 될 놈이었다고
봐, look at my mo'fuckin credits

[Verse 20: Verbal Jint]
No internet, no Genius.com
서울의 중학생에겐 암호와 비밀 같던
Digable Planets, Arrested Development
Biggie, Pac and Snoop과 DEUX의 messages
그들이 날 다신 빠져나올 수 없는 곳으로 인도했지
I fell in love with the poetry
The nowness, the grind in it
Let me take my minute
For hip-hop, 이제 올려 나의 헌사
뭘로 갚을 수 있을까 이걸 다?

[Verse 21: EK]
일회용 자극을 하나씩 통제하려 하지
난 음악 하고 싶어 시작했어 다른 것이 아닌
변해가는 상황 속에 변해가는 사람들
그 속에 제자리인 나는 동떨어진 기분
알아, 혼자일 수밖에 정상은
하지만 결코 정상적일 순 없었고
하나도 변하지 않았어 내 외길 attitude
어차피 죽는다면 난 내 음악을 남길래

[Verse 22: Reddy]
내가 rapper라서 좋은 건
돈 벌러 갈 때 별이 다섯 개의 hotel
Black van and body (Guard)
공연장과 다르게 내 방은 calm 해
블루투스 연결해 씻고 나면 밥이 (와)
하루에도 여러 개의 택배 알람이
여기 돈 쓴 건 하나도 없어, 걍 받았지
한여름인데 비니 써도 yeah, yeah, I’m cool
내 fan들처럼 난 여전히 여기 맨 앞줄

[Verse 23: Dbo]
난 hip-hop과 멀어지지 않으면서
내가 원하는 건 다 이뤄 왔어
시행착오를 겪으며 이 땅 위에 세운 내 업적
남들의 무시, 질투, 시기
타협 없이 뱉은 내 진심은 관통을 해 니 심장
10년을 해온 내 신념을 신뢰해
내 실력은 계속해 늘어나 산신령
실례합니다, 제가 지금이에요
날 싫어해도 내가 문화 이어
날씨가 좋은 듯 날 씨라 불러
니 관상을 보면 난 관뚜껑 열어
결국 물질은 가져갈 수 없어
Hip-hop, shout out to 50주년

[Verse 24: Lil Cherry]
PYE, everyday so you know these bitches Stan
I shine everyday so you know who keep it stank
I've done it all my way, yeah, that's the only right way
We shine everyday our prayers be in check (Vitamin C)
O-o-o-oh, put that vitamin c on
My bootleg designer, I still put my shit on
I'm a hustler, future baby mama with a family of nine
You keep me out of breath
Do you get it or not

[Verse 25: Loopy]
이뤄 냈지 원했던 건 뭐든
나 뿐만 아닌 내 형제들 모두
없음 만들었어 살아남는 법을
벨트를 둘러 이리 나는 champion
우리 방식은 늘 그랬듯이 savage
여기로 와 어서 너도 이미 feel this
이제 축배를 들 시간이지 big winning
그 잔을 더 위로, uh

[Verse 26: YLN Foreign]
I chase the money and fame and freedom so I keep rappin'
집에서 멀리 나온 새끼, hip-hop이 saved my life
I'm 21 years old but my love lived 50 years
아빠한테도 못 배운 거 이걸로 배웠지 throw my fear
Don't judge me, please don't judge me, 저건 who that
Mob shit or street shit, yeah, we do that
밑에 애들 전부 올라와 다시 keep another rhyme
내가 보고 다시 보여주겠지, I got through the hard time

[Verse 27: Chaboom]
Dre's Chronic, Dilla’s Donut made us, who we are
Still smoke some good shit eat and drink a lot
꿈꿨지 열다섯에
난 hip-hop을 듣고 자라나 욕심이 많아
가져야 해 돈과 여자, 명예 다
Up in smoke tour 대신 Shock 2 Da MP로
뭔 CD 살까 고민, 둘 다 쌔비기로
존나 똑같애 지금도
Gotta let it show I love the dough
And representin' 시발 안산 city til I die, bitch

[Verse 28: Keem Hyo Eun]
여전히 내 심장은 뛰어
그 리듬에 맞춰 가사를 적고 있잖아 이렇게
Uh, 뒤돌아보니 어느덧 7년
수천 명 관객 앞에 섰던 처음 그날을 기억해
Yeah, 꽤 오랫동안 빛을 잃었어
내 주위의 별들조차 느껴질 만큼 멀게
되찾아야 해, 세상의 눈을 멀게 했던 찬란함을
그렇게 살아남은 나의 hip-hop은 이제 막 시작이 되려 해

[Verse 29: Mckdaddy]
릴스 보며 낭비할 1분조차 없어 내 삶은
목표 봤고, 목표 같은 덕에 옆엔 형제들 배 다른
느린 발로 따라와서 보니 꽤 빠른 시간이 지났더라고
뒤늦게 알아
아직 그 첫 느낌까지도 난 기억해, 또 원해
이건 끝나지 않을 유행
더 가볼게, 멈추지 못하게 나의 밤을 깨워
넌 나의 완성, 난 봤어, 아직 못 봤지만 가 있어
내 이유이고 넘기는 페이지에도 있어 넌

[Verse 30: KHAN]
셀 수도 없이 많았던 어린 나의 걱정들과 고민
한 치 앞도 안 보이던 어둠 속 나의 신념들과 소신
남들이 뭐라 씨부려도 절대 꺾이지 않던 내 고집
여기엔 걱정이 없이 내 모든 걸 적었지, 영혼을 담아 영원히
아직도 난 실감이 안 나, 내 머리 위 떨어진 수많은 spotlight
슬 앵꼬가 나려던 나의 기름통에 가득 채워놨지 만땅
난 받은 걸 그대로 나눴지 그들의 귀에, I feel like a Sunshine
내 앞날엔 두려움이 없어, 날 믿고 이겨냈으니 저 tough time

[Verse 31: CHOILB]
반에 꼭 한 명씩은 있었던 그림쟁이
Rap 음악을 처음 들었을 때가 아마 중2 때지
그때부터 연습장엔 그림보다 글이 대신
내 생각을 말해줬고, 그 위에서 뿌리내린
내 음악엔 나의 삶의 향기가 진하게 배있어
Supreme 사는 게 꿈이었던 애는 다음 단계에 있어
이거 아녔음 뭐 하지? 구해줬지 날 hip-hop이
내가 죽고 나서도 내 음악들은 더 빛나길

[Verse 32: Don Mills]
거지 같은 rap이 내 유일한 무기
I promise that I'm gon' make it
길거리 출신이길 원했지만
학비만 천만 원이 넘게 든 유학생
휘청거리는 경제 사정에도 사야 돼 Timberlands
아빠의 라이터 몰래 가져와서 친구 durag 하고 바꿔
CD P는 계속 돌아, 농구공을 튀기고 놀아
Rep my city, rep my block

[Verse 33: LIL GIMCHI]
벌어야지 돈, I can never relax
안 힘들어 하나도, 고통한테 감사해
하나님이 나한테 주신 심장이 멈추는 날까지
Hustle 할 거야 진짜
그 누구보다도 나는 더 일찍 일어나서 get rich
뭘 하든 항상 진심, 난 믿어 나의 instinct
I been on that rich shit for real, naw for real
백만 원으로 억을 만들어 for real (Gimchi)

[Verse 34: ODEE]
동전한닢에 던져진 삶의 스트레스에서
그 다음 마주한 게 Deepflow, UGK, 나 그래서 했어
따질 게 또 뭔데, 넌 니가 아는 예술해
멋이 다인 게 hip-hop, 내가 아는 건 이게 섹스지
One love 찾지 말고 꺼져, 없어
내 crew 내 사람들과 나눴어
내려 입은 바지 빼곤 여기에 태도 난 안 걸쳤어
BAd at mo'fuckers, 여전하게 live in culture

[Verse 35: ChaMane]
50 years, shout out to my pioneers
한국에서 그 꽃이 피어 열매를 맺어
씨 흩뿌려 이어 내려져 온 career
갈 길 헤매이던 핏덩이에게도 일어났지 기적이
내 영웅들이 그러했듯 뭐 내 힘이 닿을 수 있다면 기꺼이
어머니 아버지 말씀하셔, ""아들아 so proud""
애초에 hip-hop이 없었다면 꿈꾸지도 못했을 날
비록 여전히 온 지 모르겠지만 그날이
우리 지나간 길 위 남아있겠지
유산이 고스란히 keep goin'

[Verse 36: KOR KASH]
한계 따윈 없어, yo pussy 전부 wussup
돈 맛 좀 보면 덥석, 진짜들은 다 법정
부모님 걱정만 내 걱정
Hip-hop에 눈 멀고 빛을 봤어
시궁창 to the top 가사
리기리에서 고백한 파산
여전히 지키고 있어
왜냐면 hip-hop은 내 심장이거든
포기를 포기, 이게 내 세 살 때 버릇
너무 뻔해진 나의 여든
내 친구들 다 지켜줄 거야
내게 맺힌 이 수천 개 땀방울
잃을 수 없어
진짜 나를 비치는 내 여자의 눈망울

[Verse 37: Street baby]
Trap 하다가 힙플에서 왔어 섭외 (Brr, brr)
Let's make an anthem 50주년, 바로 했지, okay
현성이가 말했잖아, yeah, hip-hop never die
같이 살아있는 한
끝났어 정규 앨범 다음 다음
그리고 또 다음, 내가 닿을 곳은 마음
They gonna feel it wit their heart
I’ll make that happen no matter what
Numero uno, I'm the one
다들 미쳤대 내 폼
더 끌어올려, we need more
기꺼이 받혀 이 한 몸, Street baby

[Verse 38: unofficialboyy]
정가품 여부를 모를 성과의 허물들을
쫙 빼입고 난 뒤에 어색하디 한 이 여유를
즐기질 못하는 애어른 된 청년의 꿈은
가장 닮았네 한 부분, 내가 아닌 모두를
사랑과 평화, 하나 더 끼워 재미
그게 날 움직이게 하고 널 웃게 해 baby
우리는 앞에다 무얼 붙여도 어울리는 쟁이
지킨 마음에 누구보다 아름다운 새끼‘s
Yeah, that's we

[Verse 39: FANA]
너는 손을 뻗고 유난히 성큼성큼 다가와
그 모든 것을 줬고 다시 모든 것을 앗아가
거듭 선을 넘고 달리 더는 무엇을 탓할까
결국 모른 척 멍하니 속은 것은 나잖아
너는 악마야, 내 외로운 혼을 사냥한
전부 후회하면서도 버릇처럼 적는 가사가
날 살아가고 죽게 해
잔상 같던 그때에 난 남아 과거를 배회
다 착각하던 주제에

[Verse 40: P-Type]
Uh, 아마 처음은 AFKN
그 때 내 세계엔 없던 게 튀어나와
어떤 게 이핸 안돼도 꽂혀
몇 해 뒤 내 침대맡에 MPC
이건 어느 꼰대의 ""나 때엔..."" 같은 얘기지
PC 통... 이건 다음에
상관없어 누구든
오늘 흘린 땀에 축배를 들어
모두 같이 먹자 한 살을
여기 뿌리 내린 모든 것들에 찬사를

[Verse 41: Juvie Train]
때론 계속해 돈 얘기만 해 미안해
먹고 싸기 급급해 팔 게 당신의 정신밖에 없었대
라는 치기 어린 거짓말이 곧 씨가 돼
박 터지게 맞아도 싸, 미친개는 매가 약이라네
깊이 곱씹어 본 질문, how do I 'Keep it real'?
각기 다 다른 쓰임을 인정 못했어도 상관없이
두 번째 이름과 기회를 주신 hip-hop
당신께 바치는 지구 반대편 반성문
Flow in this 감사 편지

[Verse 42: IGNITO]
영원히 타오를 것만 같던 투쟁이 끝난 뒤
악몽은 걷히고 추억이 깃든 것들이 남지
걸러낸 침전물 가득한 악취
휘적대는 손끝에 잡힌 꺾어졌던 열정의 잔가지
몇몇은 값진 영광을, 또 누군가는 쓴 맛을
많은 젊음을 깎아 만든 토대라는 결과물
못내 미련 섞인 한숨을 조각해 새겨 넣은 작품
다른 누군가는 그 발판을 딛고서 시작할 뿐

[Verse 43: Kebee]
시 쓰기 원했던 kids, verse 피웠지 아흔아홉 개
마지막 한 페이지로 완성 우리 다음 사업계획
50년의 history 중 반을 탔지 같은 배
이제 studio서 밤샐 일 없어도 계속 outselling
K-hip-hop도 이미 수많은 꾼들과 rookies
그동안 난 다음 plan, 그리고 two kids
이제는 지구 대충 집고 어디 위에도 K 붙으면 힐끔
다시 돌아갈 집은 나의 기쁨, hip-hop 내 wisdom

[Verse 44: GOLDBUDDA]
Upside-down Pegasus K-Uptown holding it down
Them snitch ass 새끼들의 phenomenon
Jit ain't gon get none
Back then used to move them
Doe like we flippin' on them megatrons
Musa far east Dangun booja looking like dem
Hologram Megatron
Ninja shoot that fire below
All my Sonja keep em 9 kilos
Talk about my people all respect me
When we done killin' them multiple shows
50주년 기념 standing still yea
We be on that throne
Hiphopplaya, Sauce Cartel
This new new far east kingdom come

[Verse 45: Minos]
뿌리는 불같은 치기, 이기적인 순수함
또 시시비비를 채로 걸러냈지
필수항목이라도 된 듯 keep it real
엿 같은 기믹
Fuck you poser, who's the best one? 대답을 바래
Beautiful Struggle 반세기 take the 힙합트레인
25년 함께 빛남, 잘 접힌 반쎄오
역사의 흐름 가운데서도 지켜내야지 태도, 멋
안 변해 그건, 못 알아듣겠음 you better run

[Verse 46: Skull]
No excuses never cop out Sniperz
반지하 방에서 우린 했지 hip-hop
이젠 Rolls 뒷좌석에서 듣고 있는 hip-hop
변명 따윈 없이 미친 듯 살았으니깐
잘 사는 이유, 어머니의 기도
이젠 웃어 넘겨 나쁜 얘기도
So mi affi grab my pen and
Show them weh mi do
Koonta, 조광일, Sajah Records
내 전부를 걸었대도

[Verse 47: Yankie]
가리온과 DT가 버틴 수십 season
꽤 해 처먹는다고 잠시 생각했던 과거와는 달리
지금 맹세하며 보내 존경 믿음
그 숨소리가 약해지지 않게 불러 이름
내 pose, 내 fales, 내 pathetic 면에 모순
내 note, 내 loves, 내 culture에 뛰는 pulse
타투는 하나 없어도 다 새겨 넣었어 모두

Well, old farmer Johnson, he had troubles of his own
He had an ornery cat just wouldn't leave his home
He tried and he tried to give that cat away
He gave him to a man going far, far away

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Verse 2]
Now, old brother Bill swore he'd kill that cat on sight
He loaded up his gun with rocks and dynamite
He waited, and he waited for that cat to come around
Forty-seven pieces of old Bill was all they found

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
You know the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Spoken]
Groovy
Everybody in the sixties knew that one
I don't remember the sixties
It's not what you think, it's cause he's too old
We're gonna need your help later in this song
We're gonna need you to make a cat noise that sounds like this
Or if you're a soprano, that sounds like this


[Verse 3]
That cat was a possesser of a family of his own
Seven little kittens till there was a cyclone
The house began to shudder, there were buildings all around
Not a single trace of one of those poor little kittens was ever found

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Verse 4]
Know, they gave him to a man going up in a balloon
They told him for to give him to the man on the moon
The balloon got busted, and down it spinned
Fifteen miles up they found that man dead

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day
Yes, the cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, he just wouldn't stay away

[Spoken]
I apologize ahead of time for this last verse for the cat lovers in the audience
But if you're feeling queezy at this point, you might want to go over to the side door over there and get your air sickness bags
At the very least, get out your earplugs, your hankys, your night shades
Whatever it takes to get through this last verse
And keep repeating to yourself, ""It's only a song""
The rest of you, think long and hard the next time you're at a fair and your standing in line for one of those Polish sausages


[Verse 5]
Well, they took him to the butcher where that meat was ground
They put him in the hopper when the butcher wasn't round
The cat went in with a blood-curdling scream, meow
Thank you, cat lovers
And the town's meat was furry for more than a week

[Chorus]
But the cat came back the very next day

Aw, baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made, but me, myself?
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
And, uh, what's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)


[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Bridge]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up


[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)

He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Outro]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home


[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face

I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe

But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around

But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are gettin' tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, lookin' for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
'Cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drownin'
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

[Chorus]
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat

I got a big ego, hahaha, I'm such a big ego, uh-uh-uh
I got a big, eh-eh-eh, ego, she love my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
So stroke my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl
'Cause every thing I throw up, blow up
Talkin' to the girl, she said, ""Know what? Grow up, you nasty,""
I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standin' next to Jay who standin' next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go, my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imaginin'
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego


[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)

If I wear my heart out on my sleeve

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home


[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl


[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl


[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

Sasha Fierce,2009,Beyoncé,Hip Hop,RnB/Swing,9303222,Russia,discogs,"66 ContributorsEgo (Remix) LyricsBeyoncé couldn’t have picked a more appropriate rapper to spit a verse on this remix than the man whose ego has gotten him into trouble more times than we can count.[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a big ego, hahaha, I'm such a big ego, uh-uh-uh
I got a big, eh-eh-eh, ego, she love my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
So stroke my big, eh-eh-eh, ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl
'Cause every thing I throw up, blow up
Talkin' to the girl, she said, ""Know what? Grow up, you nasty,""
I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standin' next to Jay who standin' next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go, my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imaginin'
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego


[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)


[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up


[Outro: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know

Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)


[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar

Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us
Cuz I keep ‘em higher than the bottom of a sky bus
Try some powder sugar pie crumbs
Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you’se a fine one
I could make your mind numb if you so decided
You don’t want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it
Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet
Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls
Come get your poison it’s funner and cheaper than a toy is
You should see my clientele I ain’t saying names but
I can build a train track everybody’s buying rails
True fact people at Warner are fuckin’ high as hell
How can you explain putting RYU’s shit up on the shelf

[Verse 2 Apathy:]
Now here is a story all about how
This old-school shit flips upside-down
See the ’80s wasn’t always so shiny and colorful
Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable
When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow
I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow
See they were teenagers misbehavers
Who left little straws, mirrors and razors
You think this shit is fly ain’t a damn thing funny
Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money
And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams
Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends
All that glitters ain’t gold I promise
Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office
Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine

Pull a bitch even if she dislikes my music
Understand what you see in me is every girls fantasy

Call your pops tell him wire us some money baby
I get a job and I’ll pay him back tomorrow maybe
Not, yea shoot me up take a shot
Share a needle and fuck, this is how we rock yea
I could never stop I could never get enough
Pop another pill, sniff, take another puff
Are we happily in love or is it just lust
The only time we get along is when were getting fucked up
For real, they say we bad for each other
Forget rehab I ain’t trying to fucking recover
Tell your mother I can quit whenever I choose to
I don’t need that dumb bitch and that Dr. Drew dude
You can do you, I’m'a do guess who? Yes me
I can shoot a balloon and make it look it sexy
It’s a, hard rock life I live it out of focus
Looking for a vein to spike before I’m dope sick

Blowing money arrogant, I’m so american

Turn veins and syringes to angel wings
So kids just say “no” or just stick with blow
It took my brother away, the H ate his soul
Kick start his heart, too late he’s gone
Show him love in a song like I must go on
Fuck around I’ll be chilling down in heroin town
Willimantic CT is where I’m usually found
Get busy like Debbie Harry, bury your nose in it
Don’t bother fixing your hair, don’t worry it goes with it
It seemed like a long shot, but soon as this song drop
You see fiends bringing iPods to pawn shops
Shoot me up I’m biggie, shoot me up I’m 50

I see the devil in ‘em
In your eyes

I feel good
Even though I shouldn’t
I’m chilling so hard couldn’t tell you where the hood is
I’m looking like a million bucks
Sucka I’m sorry
Jeep so clean might as well be a Ferrari
Took off the top like an African safari
Heading to the beach cause I heard the waves are gnarly
No flip flops just a pair of old Barkleys
Got the golden ticket like I took that shit from Charlie
Hardly the day to complain
Ima save that for later
Right now I’m too busy being lazy as a gator
Even if I seen a hater
Wouldn’t tell him eat a dick
Cause my shit is hotter than a chicken incubator is
Got a smile on my face
And a roll full of dough
Feeling great cuz I just ate a hot bowl of Pho
Make a stop at the store
Grab a 40 for the road
Who am I kidding make it two and a pack of smokes

[Chorus]
I feel good
And it sounds kinda gangsta
I’m sorry but I guess it’s in my nature
Vibrating got the bass all cranked up
Chilling in that ‘85 Samurai, say what


[Verse 2: Apathy]
Man I love these palm trees
They’re so different from the east
Subwoofers bumping beats
Keep a lookout for police
Cause I’m still drinking 40s like it’s 1993
Listening to a cassette of DOC and Diamond D
Got a shirt with a koala and I’m rocking Wallabees
Follow me
But it’s kinda hard when I’m wobbly
'Cause the turntables wobble gotta rock 'em properly
Got 'em from my man who got 'em in a little robbery
And I’ll sell 'em for a G
They’re ain’t shit your telling me
'Cause I know it before you say it like I got telepathy
Want to diss before you know me well I know it’s jealousy
Caught you walking down the street whistling this melody
And I’m booming
Im booming
Ap is so fly it’s hard to believe that I’m human
More like a mutant
Start a revolution
Better start cruising
Before they start shooting

[Refrain]


[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Booming down the block in the drop top
Haters catch a soft spot
'Cause I does it nonstop
You ain’t got it on lock
Run in to that pawn shop
Try to sell that cheap chain trade it for a small watch
Got the Uzi palmed cocked
Got the posse on deck
You ain’t puffing like me
We could have a contest
Not to disrespect but I really like your mom's breast
Oops I mean your mom's fresh, I’m just being honest
It’s funny all the shit that floats around in my self-concious
I’m pumping up my ego
People say I’m pompous
Acting like a Chief like I fucked Pocahontas
Maybe it’s just you ain’t used to being around bosses

Matching grills, I like you braids
You could fill the position
You could be my sexy assistant
When I'm doin the trick
I put you in the mix and then we can all get real explicit
A tisket, a tasket
Girl let me work my magic
Unzip it, your trippin
Like you just took some acid
Its mystic, ethereal
That silky, material
Girl I ain't ever sharing you
Like Lucky Charms cereal
I'm feelin you

You stole my soul right from my flesh

A lot of suckas wanna try to take my fame
You just mad cuz all you do is the same old thang
I just laugh
Still sparking the same old flames
Slick talking, moonwalking all over LA

Like I love my Committee
Trigger finger is itchy you know we getting it busy

Couldn’t see it was hurting you inside plus
I was certain that you would never leave my side cuz
Ain’t nobody closer than you and I was

On the surface we were inseparable
On the low I was being too sensual
Put myself in a bad position and I did something that I wish I didn’t

I’m done with thinking dumpin her will punish her
The pussy pushed me to the point I almost wanna pummel her
That little hussy hustled me and ran off with some hustler
That’s why I seem disgusted every time i start discussing her

Come and talk to me
Cuz if you know we don’t care there
There’s a couple over there that I’m gonna say
Can I talk to you?
If I decide to
I really wanna
Just get inside you

[Ryu]
I really wanna get to know you better
Grow old together be ya big papa
You could be my mama like Voletta Wallace
Look inside my wallet you could tell I ain’t got a baller bitch
But I’d you find a dollar you can spend it all
All of it
I ain’t making promises or prophisizing profit
If it’s possible to talk to you I’ll put some in your pocket boo
I could be your dog but
Ryu ain’t no Cockapoo
So if you want to walk
Ima treat you like a prostitute

Treat her like a prostitute
I’m H town when i’m knocking boots
Not so rich but I’m locking those chicks
Don’t wear skinny jeans cuz my cock won’t fit

You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar

Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us
Cuz I keep ‘em higher than the bottom of a sky bus
Try some powder sugar pie crumbs
Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you’se a fine one
I could make your mind numb if you so decided
You don’t want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it
Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet
Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls
Come get your poison it’s funner and cheaper than a toy is
You should see my clientele I ain’t saying names but
I can build a train track everybody’s buying rails
True fact people at Warner are fuckin’ high as hell
How can you explain putting RYU’s shit up on the shelf

[Verse 2 Apathy:]
Now here is a story all about how
This old-school shit flips upside-down
See the ’80s wasn’t always so shiny and colorful
Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable
When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow
I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow
See they were teenagers misbehavers
Who left little straws, mirrors and razors
You think this shit is fly ain’t a damn thing funny
Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money
And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams
Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends
All that glitters ain’t gold I promise
Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office
Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine
I never knew a single soul who owned a rope chain",en,"You see us coming through the door with our hoods up Eyes low sipping on that good stuff And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar You see us coming through the door with our hoods up Eyes low sipping on that good stuff And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us Cuz I keep ‘em higher than the bottom of a sky bus Try some powder sugar pie crumbs Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you’se a fine one I could make your mind numb if you so decided You don’t want to try it quiet I can make your mind up You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls Come get your poison it’s funner and cheaper than a toy is You should see my clientele I ain’t saying names but I can build a train track everybody’s buying rails True fact people at Warner are fuckin’ high as hell How can you explain putting RYU’s shit up on the shelf Now here is a story all about how This old-school shit flips upside-down See the ’80s wasn’t always so shiny and colorful Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow See they were teenagers misbehavers Who left little straws, mirrors and razors You think this shit is fly ain’t a damn thing funny Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends All that glitters ain’t gold I promise Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine I never knew a single soul who owned a rope chain",-0.996286153793335,2009.0,,

Call your pops tell him wire us some money baby
I get a job and I’ll pay him back tomorrow maybe
Not, yea shoot me up take a shot
Share a needle and fuck, this is how we rock yea
I could never stop I could never get enough
Pop another pill, sniff, take another puff
Are we happily in love or is it just lust
The only time we get along is when were getting fucked up
For real, they say we bad for each other
Forget rehab I ain’t trying to fucking recover
Tell your mother I can quit whenever I choose to
I don’t need that dumb bitch and that Dr. Drew dude
You can do you, I’m'a do guess who? Yes me
I can shoot a balloon and make it look it sexy
It’s a, hard rock life I live it out of focus
Looking for a vein to spike before I’m dope sick

I feel good
Even though I shouldn’t
I’m chilling so hard couldn’t tell you where the hood is
I’m looking like a million bucks
Sucka I’m sorry
Jeep so clean might as well be a Ferrari
Took off the top like an African safari
Heading to the beach cause I heard the waves are gnarly
No flip flops just a pair of old Barkleys
Got the golden ticket like I took that shit from Charlie
Hardly the day to complain
Ima save that for later
Right now I’m too busy being lazy as a gator
Even if I seen a hater
Wouldn’t tell him eat a dick
Cause my shit is hotter than a chicken incubator is
Got a smile on my face
And a roll full of dough
Feeling great cuz I just ate a hot bowl of Pho
Make a stop at the store
Grab a 40 for the road
Who am I kidding make it two and a pack of smokes

[Chorus]
I feel good
And it sounds kinda gangsta
I’m sorry but I guess it’s in my nature
Vibrating got the bass all cranked up
Chilling in that ‘85 Samurai, say what


[Verse 2: Apathy]
Man I love these palm trees
They’re so different from the east
Subwoofers bumping beats
Keep a lookout for police
Cause I’m still drinking 40s like it’s 1993
Listening to a cassette of DOC and Diamond D
Got a shirt with a koala and I’m rocking Wallabees
Follow me
But it’s kinda hard when I’m wobbly
'Cause the turntables wobble gotta rock 'em properly
Got 'em from my man who got 'em in a little robbery
And I’ll sell 'em for a G
They’re ain’t shit your telling me
'Cause I know it before you say it like I got telepathy
Want to diss before you know me well I know it’s jealousy
Caught you walking down the street whistling this melody
And I’m booming
Im booming
Ap is so fly it’s hard to believe that I’m human
More like a mutant
Start a revolution
Better start cruising
Before they start shooting

[Refrain]


[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Booming down the block in the drop top
Haters catch a soft spot
'Cause I does it nonstop
You ain’t got it on lock
Run in to that pawn shop
Try to sell that cheap chain trade it for a small watch
Got the Uzi palmed cocked
Got the posse on deck
You ain’t puffing like me
We could have a contest
Not to disrespect but I really like your mom's breast
Oops I mean your mom's fresh, I’m just being honest
It’s funny all the shit that floats around in my self-concious
I’m pumping up my ego
People say I’m pompous
Acting like a Chief like I fucked Pocahontas

You could fill the position
You could be my sexy assistant

I put you in the mix and then we can all get real explicit

Unzip it, your trippin
Like you just took some acid
Its mystic, ethereal
That silky, material
Girl I ain't ever sharing you

I'm feelin you

I know how mean ya mother get

I’m really down to Earth like I fell out of the mothership
Better turn that bass down before she say some other shit
I know how mean ya mother get

Pluck money out ya pocket like *gank*

She slapped told me don’t be acting like Apathys running her
I’m done with her
I’m done with thinking dumpin her will punish her
The pussy pushed me to the point I almost wanna pummel her
That little hussy hustled me and ran off with some hustler
That’s why I seem disgusted every time i start discussing her

A heart that was broken, but it wasn't the first or the last time

Under the wings of the man they called Green, I found freedom
Three children, one wife, a twist of the knife and a scandal

They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

[Verse 1]
They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged

""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

[Verse 2]
He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay


He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be


Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be

O il coraggio di farti capire, darling

Mi guardi negli occhi e non parli, magari
Puoi sentirmi piangere


Hold me, love me
Ma che senso ha
Stare così bene
Se non durerà

Hold me, trust me
Don’t you go away
Io impazzisco baby
E tu invece pensi che

Che anche questa storia finisce
E come tutte le storie
Alla fine sparisce, honey
