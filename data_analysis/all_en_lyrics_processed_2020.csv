Feel you like a rainbow in the dark
I got a million dollars and a broken heart
Someone out there could use

They know my name, the thieves and louts
They got no soul, just techno and house
And you're not even as old as my tattoos

I am the Blues
I am the Blues

I talk real sweet, I talk real slow
I'm the voice you've loved on the radio
A pirate with a breast of gold
That stuff makes slaves get bought and sold

Help me, help me realise
I just forgot the colour of my own eyes
All we do is hurt and break and bruise

I am the Blues
I am the Blues

I'm as blue as the Côte d'Azur
And both of us are not so pure
Do I still belong to her?
Aidez-moi, aidez-moi, I can't choose


I am the Blues

Falling through the cracks
The ticker tape and tax
Getting up the back of the music whores and hacks

I stood up to dance
I lost my balance
But my faith in France
Some things you can't lose

I am the Blues, oh I am the Blues

The source of her strength, the freedom from her fears
She picks a lonely guitar in the corner of the room
And sings aloud to no one the sketches of a tune

There's song they sing in heaven - a simple sweet refrain
A chord they play together that doesn't have a name
A melody that's found riding on the wind
It greets you like a stranger and leaves you as a friend

When there's nothing left for leaving and the golden sun has set
Say goodnight to the day and lay your head to rest
Deep within your dreams a silver light will shine
The earth will open up and pull you deep inside

Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again

Holding my hand as I start to pray
Follow me down and I bide my tide
Promise me peace on the other side

So say that you're here, that you'll hold the line
And I will lie, saying that I'm fine

Will you hear me?

Just be good to me (Woo)
Come on, get up
Clap your hands

Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance, come on
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me

[Verse 1]
Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me

[Chorus]
People always talk about reputation
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Friends are always tellin' me you're a user
I don't care, I don't care
Just be good to me, oh

You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You'll never do that to me
Oh, no, no

I won't let you down
When you need me, baby
I'll be around
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me
We will be together, be together, oh
Just be good


[Verse 3]
Life is a game of chances
So I'll take my chance with you
And you I won't try to change
We talk about it and I'd
Rather have a piece of you
Than to have all of nothing

[Chorus]
So just be good to me in the morning time, baby
In the afternoon or evening, yeah
Just be good to me

Won't you show me a sign
And at the end of the darkest day
You got to know that I would never go away
'Cause I'm hear to stay

Now you must forget
What you've lived before
All the times you were let down
Now it's the final truth and nothing more
I will always be around

You rocking that designer but you so vagina

Clack click, army tactics give you a nap bitch

Paint a picture never use the canvas

For my workers I would pay 'em with food for bagging up

'99 I took the shit to the street the block would flood
I been nice most of y'all quit we kept it growin'
On the game Lord while most of y'all bitch we kept it goin'
Took a hit, turned the shit to some chips Ephederine flowin'
Welcome home for those who just hit the brick, it's time to go in

Love a ho? Never for nothing, I don't need em

Got problems, you bring 'em to us, but we don't do counseling
Want dram, bring your crew out then

Banging heads with prophecy
Lavish in uncertainty

Who will I be?
How will I live to tell what I have seen?
Must I endure the hell that comes with the peace?
An equilibrium of god's own release
What does it all mean?
How can he justify?
How can we breathe
When the stagnancy's choking me?
How can we dream
Of better reality?
How do you sleep at night?

Take this doubt and fear to your grave

This life of stone
The hand of god I'm too tempted to bribe
I'm getting old and growing paralyzed
We're all alone
Until we let our minds take to the skies
Our blood runs cold yet we remain alive

What's the confliction between heart and mind?
How to bridge the void?
Fuse the two in kinship
To understand your prospects and vistas
And yet to see the love here too
It's more than I can do
Vows and pursuits which at best hollow
I remain torn in two


Just seize the moment
Sabotage the lines
Life turns on a dime
Please cease the torment
It's weighing on my mind
The pressure you apply won't hold

I wish I was a comet
Burning up into the night
I wish I was a comet

So we don't hold hands in daylight
I still drag the closet
All my limbs, they ache inside
And surely, all my family and my friends
My god and my ends
They cannot all be wrong
So I play along:

[Pre-Chorus]
We refrain from touch
We are satellites (Da dada dada da)
In a cosmic dance
Amongst the northern lights (Da dada dada da)
And we orbit fast
But I wish we could collide
I'm sick of concealing
I'm sick of the feeling
I no longer want to hide

'Cause I think it could be love

But I can't show you enough

Someone bring me down to land
And write a prayer to Venus
What is life without affection

If we could tread so lightly that the bait in my breath is done
Grind down, the grief gives way, justify just another one
The mourning ends, the maker mends and you feed it
And with your nothing words, stand by the lie
Watch your saviour bleed

So give us something more than the wretch
Than the pose of the penitent
And with a rapture wracked
Spit back the impact in the garden

The shots don't miss, and you know it
Call for a binding, blade to the boy
And bite down until it's all done

[Verse 1]
This is the way that we hand control to gravity's grip
The way that it goes
Before we can rise we must be laid low
Bloodied, alive, I make it to my knees
Only to pray they won't forget me
Cast to the ground when I reached for the war
(So climb)
Rise in the rot and set the pace to stay
The heart is the way where the markers were laid
Higher again until we're leaving our own
(We climb)

The fight and the form
The ever forward, mine
Boot to the hold
One tread at a time
Hand over hand
The path as it winds
So climb

So rise radiant
You are the way
You were born to the ascent
So rise, my radiant
With my pride, bear your heart into the end of me

There is no death
I am with you, my darling
If I am breathing through you
Death only is to wake
With the face of our fathers below
And no fear to follow the way forward

There is no pride

We watch survivors trace their old calligraphy

In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along

No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up

Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground


[Chorus 2: Lynsey Ward]
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place
Where we belong

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up
Gotta walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go

In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good

[Verse 2: Jim Grey]
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground


[Chorus 2: Lynsey Ward]
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place
Where we belong

[Bridge: Lynsey Ward & Jim Grey]
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up
Gotta walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no one needs

Once upon a time, in a tiny little town, in a tiny little house, where no one came around
There lived a bird who was just so sad
For this little bird didn't have a mom or a dad
He had forgotten how to fly, and he had lost the will to try
Until one day, a bear came around, and the bird heard its terrible sound
And through his fear, his courage did appear
He lifted once more from the ground

[Verse 1]
Show me through your animal heart, and not through your mind
You and I can't find our ""one""
Throws me naked into the eternal
Don't go now
You and I run

[Chorus]
In a world that's so inviting
Find your own sanctuary and play along

[Verse 2]
Show me to the fundamental tenet
Hard times have come to return
You and I can't find our ""one""

[Chorus]
(Everyone, everybody
Everyone, everybody)
In a world that's subdivided
Hold your own ceremony, and carry on


[Post-Chorus]
Soul, soul and the body are broken-hearted
So, sons and your daughters are broken-hearted
But know, only the body is broken, hardened

[Break]
Show me to the fear that's in your mind
Show me through your animal heart, and not through your mind
(You and I can't find our one)

[Chorus]
(Everyone, everybody
Everyone, everybody)
In a world that's self-divided
You count your hopes, face the morning, and pray along

[Bridge]
Think of everyone you know
Everybody is broken
Take a look around, everyone is sad
Monsters and robots are broken-hearted
Octopus lovers are broken-hearted
Dad in the garden, all broken-hearted
Thank you for the morning and the light
But more than this
Thank you for keeping trying

Can't stop thinking about what I know

Can't stop thinking of the universe

I keep rocking, I keep rolling
Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there
Keep dropping, keep rolling
Put out the fire with the water
Thinking creosote

I the morning with a beat up bud I know
I can't fight a war without losing blood

In the morning 'bout three or so
Can't stop seeking what I need to know
God is in the mountain as is in the rock
And god is not concerned about keeping stock

So keep rocking, keep rolling
Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there
Keep dropping, keep rolling
Put out the fire with the water
Thinking creosote

Once upon a time, in a tiny little town, in a tiny little house, where no one came around
There lived a bird who was just so sad
For this little bird didn't have a mom or a dad
He had forgotten how to fly, and he had lost the will to try
Until one day, a bear came around, and the bird heard its terrible sound
And through his fear, his courage did appear
He lifted once more from the ground

[Verse 1]
Show me through your animal heart, and not through your mind
You and I can't find our ""one""
Throws me naked into the eternal
Don't go now
You and I run

[Chorus]
In a world that's so inviting
Find your own sanctuary and play along

[Verse 2]
Show me to the fundamental tenet
Hard times have come to return
You and I can't find our ""one""

[Chorus]
(Everyone, everybody
Everyone, everybody)
In a world that's subdivided
Hold your own ceremony, and carry on


[Post-Chorus]
Soul, soul and the body are broken-hearted
So, sons and your daughters are broken-hearted
But know, only the body is broken, hardened

[Break]
Show me to the fear that's in your mind
Show me through your animal heart, and not through your mind
(You and I can't find our one)

[Chorus]
(Everyone, everybody
Everyone, everybody)
In a world that's self-divided
You count your hopes, face the morning, and pray along

[Bridge]
Think of everyone you know
Everybody is broken
Take a look around, everyone is sad
Monsters and robots are broken-hearted
Octopus lovers are broken-hearted
Dad in the garden, all broken-hearted
Thank you for the morning and the light
But more than this
Thank you for keeping trying

Couple of vagabonds, fond of being on the run
We never stick around long enough to orbit the sun
And go in guns a-blazin’, never call it a draw
Aligning “straight outer space,” we above the law
Check it, I’ve got the medicine, cosmic adrenaline
Cause, effect, iron and nerves of steel settle in
Bet that we don’t gotta be like everybody else
Focused in on cars, cash, stars, image and wealth
Now health’s on the back-burner, counting every calorie
Rather be a bounty hunter’s cheap-shot salary
Proud to be, wild and free, know you got a pal in me
Runaways sailing through a cut-throat galaxy
We could be the heroes, or the villainous crew
Because they’re killing us for money, and we gotta break through
Too weird to live, but still not safe enough to make it big
Blow it, if the system is rigged!!
Cuz we’re all so...

[Chorus]
SPACED OUT!!
Chasing down the next “sitting pretty” place to stay
Those days are gone, the pressure’s on
Be another legendary stray! I won’t die
FACE DOWN
No sweat! Forget about a “back in the day”
Ready or not, the futures comin’ in hot so
Space if ya wanna!!
Up up and away!


[Verse 2]
Ways to go, I kept my eyes on the wrong street
Treasures of invisible pasts, I found ‘em so sweet
Sold my soul to seek ‘em out, When I easily could do without
Golden memories that were never ours, forget about 'em
Gettin’ louder, makin’ moves, seeing ever clearer
With our reservations sittin’ in the rear view mirror
The fear of the sheer love for people that I idolized
Hideous indifference had cut me down to size, so
Here’s a little tip so you can see what I see
The old dogs, old tricks, triple-N mentality
Nobody tryna’ link with you, ya wastin’ your breath
But if ya can’t join ’em, you can always beat ’em to death!!! (You got it?)
Kick it like the pierrot but we gettin’ kinda weary cuz
No one really knows if we just playin’ or we serious
Fuck the way they jeer at us, stemmin’ from their fear of us
Still keep it downright delirious
Also?

Galaxy-wide? Nah I ain’t gotta be notorious
Inglorious me, who still can’t write a proper story
Must have lost a couple marbles on the way, from my view?
There ain’t no trouble like a double-life rendezvous
I choose to gun it, cuz our universe is ever-extending
Tell me, aren’t you sick of stressin’, tryna guess at the ending?
Pretending like we’re heroes of the planet we’re defending
I’m sending off yesterday- gonna cast off all the bitter feelings
Ambiguity, we kickin’ it just you and me
Tryna find the silver lining, game is full of lunacy
If you sticking to the past you gonna run it like a slave
This is comin from the chick who said “FUCK THE NEW WAVE!!!” You an enemy or homie, I swear ya gonna know me

Couple of vagabonds, fond of being on the run
We never stick around long enough to orbit the sun
And go in guns a-blazin’, never call it a draw
Aligning “straight outer space,” we above the law
Check it, I’ve got the medicine, cosmic adrenaline
Cause, effect, iron and nerves of steel settle in
Bet that we don’t gotta be like everybody else
Focused in on cars, cash, stars, image and wealth
Now health’s on the back-burner, counting every calorie
Rather be a bounty hunter’s cheap-shot salary
Proud to be, wild and free, know you got a pal in me
Runaways sailing through a cut-throat galaxy
We could be the heroes, or the villainous crew
Because they’re killing us for money, and we gotta break through
Too weird to live, but still not safe enough to make it big
Blow it, if the system is rigged!!
Cuz we’re all so...

[Verse 2]
Ways to go, I kept my eyes on the wrong street
Treasures of invisible pasts, I found ‘em so sweet
Sold my soul to seek ‘em out, When I easily could do without
Golden memories that were never ours, forget about 'em
Gettin’ louder, makin’ moves, seeing ever clearer
With our reservations sittin’ in the rear view mirror
The fear of the sheer love for people that I idolized
Hideous indifference had cut me down to size, so
Here’s a little tip so you can see what I see
The old dogs, old tricks, triple-N mentality
Nobody tryna’ link with you, ya wastin’ your breath
But if ya can’t join ’em, you can always beat ’em to death!!! (You got it?)
Kick it like the pierrot but we gettin’ kinda weary cuz
No one really knows if we just playin’ or we serious
Fuck the way they jeer at us, stemmin’ from their fear of us
Still keep it downright delirious

Skype the plug (Hello?)

Fuck, school, I feel like Pepper Ann
Fuck, you, boy, I can’t shake your hand

Lighten up your back, 36 holes

[Verse 3: Adam Kane]
Cat, cat
This cat got me cocky
Feel like Rocky on the steps
No, they cannot stop me
Sippin’ drank up on the lawn, no it’s not some [?]
Smoking Bomb with your mom out in Nagasaki
Hit the 12 o’clock position on the [?]
In this life my only mission is to get it poppin’
Martha Stewart hit my line and she said “When you droppin’?”
I said, “Baby, give me time”
And then back to shopping
I don’t know what failure is ‘cuz it’s just not an option
Chopping up the [?] like I’m Eric Carston
[?] my car cuz I don’t mind what it’s really costing
Dentist hit my line and said I grind and I’m over flossin’
I just went online and had to copped some rain gear
Shawty said I’m wildin’, doesn’t even rain here!

Hi my name is Carmen Winstead
[Verse: Carmen Winstead]
I'm 17 years old
I am very similar to you
Did I mention to you that I'm dead?
A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me
When I didn't come back up the police came
The girl said that I had fell and everyone believed them
The police found my body in the sewer
I had a broken neck and my face was torn off
Send this message to 15 peoplе after you listened thе whole message if you value your life
A boy called David received this message
He just left and deleted it
When he was in the shower he heard laughing
My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late
The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have him back'
No one has found his body yet because he is with me
A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required
I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger
Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's

I wanted to be real, wanted to be real

Graduated from the situation, found a solution
Smoking on the pollution, all black suit
Black gloves on, just like a hitman
Trash Star Boys and we sleep in a coffin
Wake up, drinking coffee
I get to it often, might get to it this morning
Prada boots on, look like some Jordans
I'm playing, I'm scoring
DG, Nike, they supporting
Just do it, blade on me, I'm swording
I'm veiled when I'm wielding
Knife in my heart but, man, fuck how I'm feeling
Can't look at me, you're dreaming
Can't even see me when you are sleeping
Black Volvo, we're creeping

[Chorus]
I had ups and downs but it's falling into place
Like the love from God when you look me in my face
I had dreams of life that were lost in empty space
I had almost drowned if I didn't fuck with that drain
I had four, five strikes, at the sixth I lost my wings
I'm the puppeteer, put my puppets into play

I'm my own biggest enemy
Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
Feelin' somethin' like a scaly thing
Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master
My friends are gettin' bored of me
Sayin' I fell in love with a stranger
I don't know what they all think of me
But in reality, I don't even

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember anything but thinkin' you're the one
And I can force a future like it's nothing

[Chorus]
So I'll just hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't

[Verse 2]
I know I've got a tendency
To exaggerate what I'm seein'
And I know that it's unfair of me
To make a memory out of a feelin'
It's 'cause I notice every single thing
That's ever happening in the moment
And I don't know why it's consumin' me
Because honestly, all I know is


[Pre-Chorus]
Infatuation's observation with a cause
But none of it is love, so while I'm waitin' for it

[Chorus]
I'll hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't

If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody

Darling, I've just left the bar
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and all of my reservations
Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me, do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone please come and flirt with me
I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time

Come on and make me feel alright again

While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone

I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me

Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet

You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

And I'm terrified, but I can't resist

Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong

Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar

You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

When it's all a part of me?

Wanna scream, but what's the use?

I really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'm being dead serious (I gotta see this birth certificate)
Okay, I'll prove it

[Verse]
Well, who am I? I'm almost twenty-five
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside (Eastside)
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
""Oh my God, there's no way that's me""
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I've tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation


[Chorus]
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself

[Interlude]
I think I have a confession to make (So we know you don't)
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
I saw my birth certificate and I'm a liar
And I'm a fucking liar

So deep in love those days

Like a lost Christmas that day

But only hope some way
Just to see her once more

I keep on messing with my mind torn apart

Always thinking it's near the end
And I was hoping she'd be my friend
Lost forever, only wishing again
Oh, to be alive and free from sin

Psycho love in The Twilight Zone
Drippy soap opera on the telephone
I get so close, but I don't belong
Straining to identify with the radio song


Then I see her as if in a dream
It's so real, I could almost scream
She's doing her ritual, the same for any man
Just like a movie, it's so deadpan

I'm looking for love in the darkness
I haven't a chance at false romance
Maybe next time I'll whisper something new
I'm so ashamed, so unglued

I've had enough and she'll never know
I feel like staying, but my subconscious says, ""Go""
Shed a tear like blood on the porch

Watching from afar and growing further apart

Ignored the cages set before

The vicar's tears fell as he faced the cameramen
My mother grabbed her crucifix and drew in her breath
It's suspected arson, the newsreader said
My life was reborn into that incendiary darkness
It brought to mind the great writers of satanic verses
From that truth my eyes glowed with unholy illumination
From the matchstick spark until the final glowing embers

I'm called by the light of burning churches
I'm saved by the light of burning churches

I was always the altar boy and never a thief
Part of the choir and friends with the priest
But it all changed when those prayer books went up in flames
Childhood on fire, consumed in the blaze
Now I smoke all my opportunities right down to the filter
I don't regret a single fucking moment of my future
And I know the devil better than himself
There's no good fun in Heaven

I'm saved by the light of burning churches

There's plenty of things that should be left unsaid
So I'll drink some more whiskey and I'll say them again
My life is this war against their words
Slaves to salvation and prayers to their lord
I'll take up my seat next to Anton LaVey
With a Molotov cocktail and a can of gasoline
Oh, ashes up to Heaven
Beautiful destruction

I was raised by that light

""So you'll be mine or you'll be dead""

I swear I did it for the love I've felt
But preacher told me I will go to Hell
And locked the door of my prison cell

Well, I met her at Saint Mary's square
On the way to the bar I used to drink
That angel's face with charming smile
I said hello, she answered with a wink
Oh, that's how it started
No one knew how bad this would end
She said that I'm the only one
But has cheated with another man

Her voice was sweet like a serenade
Her body was a masterpiece
I placed a ring on her finger
And I was down on my knees
But Heaven's brought all Hell to Earth

Claustrophobia
Conditioned air

Don't crash - no flowers for you
Don't crash - and no regrets

Gushing waters
Forcing it down
Days stars final flicker urging on the break of dawn

Stand fast - voices screech below
Stand fast - no clemency

Panic stricken faces
Diving further down into hell

Don't crash - no flowers for you
Don't crash - and no regrets

Timeless terror is taking over
Throbbing hearts and restless bones are melted into one

Stand fast - voices screech below
Stand fast - no clemency


Breath slowly fading
Partly anger and partly stress

Stand fast - air is sparse below
Stand fast - no clemency

Been detected
Losing power
Deeper down we grovel on our sweating bending knees

Don't crash - no flowers for you
Don't crash - and no regrets

Last moment cries on the radio
It is so hot down here
Crushing metal bloody water
Same faces everywhere
Now the anger is fading
Now the fight can't go on
We'll always be remembered
We'll always be dismembered
Now the anger is fading
Now the fight can't go on
We'll always be remembered
We'll always be dismembered

Lovely day
He never expected such a lovely day
Be sure he'll find you back someday

It was a lovely day
The day you walked away
Revenge came out to play
When you refused to stay
He walks through empty lanes
Cold anger, bursting veins
Now that I've lost your track
How could I bring you back

Be sure he won't forget
'Cause the last words you said
Disrupt his head with morning quivers
Dissect his heart like golden scissors
Make him regret each moment spent with you
Make him regret what he intended to do
Too late to stop this agony

Please...Don't...Ask...Me...For...More
Lovely day
He never expected such a gift


There's too much on my mind
To leave it all behind
Just hoping that I find
There's too much on my mind
Wait now for the night
The prey, the kill, the flight
Return then of the light
Won't reveal any displeasure

I almost close down from all that I hide
I know things are better when you're by my side
I'm hoping you see that I'm honestly trying

And when it needs a drop of water
It doesn't have to ask the rain to come

I don't wanna try to be
Something that you're looking for

Let the stars catch your eye

And I won't do

Just because it hasn't yet been found
And no one blames the moon for not shining
Just because it's hidden by a cloud

I don't wanna blame myself
Thinking that I'm not enough
And wonder what's wrong with me
Because I couldn't win your love

And fades from the Midwest Sky
And the corn and the trees wave in the breeze

In nineteen and forty three

He grew life from the soil and seed

But what will be my harvest now
Where every tear that falls on a memory
Feels like rain on the rusted plow
Rain on the rusted plow

And these fields they dream of wheat in the summertime
Grandchildren running free
And the bales of hay at the end of the day
And the scarecrow that just scared me
Now the houses they grow like weeds in a flower bed
This morning the silo fell
Seems the only way a man can live off the land these days
Is to buy and sell

So I'm goin' down to the dreaming fields
But what will be my harvest now
Where every tear that falls on a memory
Feels like rain on the rusted plow
Rain on the rusted plow


Like the rain on the roof on the porch by the kitchen
Where as my grandmother sings, I can hear if I listen

Hey when you leave don't leave no room for doubt

Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

[Verse 2]
So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said ""You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food""


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now they're smokin' up the junk bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

Coming after me

I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hanging around
Say, listen baby
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom

How could my sunshine

Backstroke lover
Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, ""You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways""
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss

You act like a prima donna
Playin' so hard to get
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant
Draggin' on a cigarette
You keep a wall all around you
I'll get through some day
I want your love, babe, but push come to shove
Gonna chip that wall away

[Chorus]
Chip away, chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away, that's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama, I wanna get next to you

[Verse 2]
You stand like a marble statue
Tryin' to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress
While the boys all promenade
Even a rock will crumble
If you strike it night and day
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
Gonna chip that stone away


[Chorus]
Chip away, chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away, that's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama, I wanna get next to you

Trackateering Music
Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all
People love to use that quote, ""I'm doin' it for the culture""
But what culture is that that you're talking about?
The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist
But won't do the research on hip-hop history
Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect
And disregard the founding fathers?
But you know what? Whatever it is, it don't even matter
'Cause as long as I'm alive
I'ma show and prove where this culture came from
And what it's really all about
I got you, my nigga, yo, ayo
[Verse 1: Sheek Louch, DJ Kay Slay]
Count to ten and then come in shootin' (Yeah)
Fuck peace, Silverback the new Huey Newton (D-Block)
I feel it, it's in the air, white cop with a stare
New judge in the chair, this shit hittin' the fan (Woo)
But me, I'ma be smart and legalize my shit
And I ain't leavin' the house without that in my hand (Ahh)
And it ain't only the cops, it's niggas on your block (Uh-huh)
That talk like a lil' bitch and act like they your man

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Somethin' like Kris Parker, my Uzi weigh a ton
Hundred niggas on the track, then you know I'll be the one
To tell niggas to suck cock, run and get a gun
It's old P, new P, prob'ly layin' in the sun
Prob'ly on a P.I., if I call you king
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap, nigga, that status go to B.I
You can fuck around and get burnt like a C.I
More bars than jail, nigga, who tryna get a V.I?


[Verse 3: Dave East]
You dealing with stock owners, conversation with stockbrokers
Make a call for coco, smokin' dope from my crop grower
The block know us, kush got a funky sock odor
How could you not notice? I come from that rock culture (Rock)
Star of the squad but they cannot coach (At all)
Louis Vuitton holster, this for my niggas in the cell
And on they wall, they got a Nicki Minaj poster
The talk's over, no drive-by's, we walked over

[Verse 4: KXNG Crooked]
COB bandana tied to the end of the AR
Iller than they are, rhymes so sick, give 'em the day off
This is the chaos, Nicolas Cage, face off
The dark knight, I make it a dark night when I'm gettin' that K off
Better than whoever done it, even officers better run it
With the drum, I got a technique that'll give twelve a hundred
Now the tables turn, to whom it may concern
I used to control more shooters than David Stern
With Lucifer, hater burn

[Verse 5: Black Thought]
Yo, I was in the park spray-painting on the platform
Patent leather top ten, Space Invader hats on
Eighty-something, I've been a threat for that long
Where a lot of people get poked up and clapped on
My job really putting on for the city
You get popped like a wheelie for saying some old silly shit
Tell me it'll be safer to say it in Swahili
They be wheeling you away if you say it in South Philly


[Verse 6: Conway the Machine]
Look, thirty shots, I'm shootin' to peel his top (Huh?)
When them niggas sending shots, they shootin' to get the spot
That I'm in, nigga (Hahaha)
You know what it is when I spin the block (Uh-huh)
Uppin' this Draco, the witness is still in shock (Brrr!)
Fluffin' a brick of this yayo, I tilt the pot (Whip)
Tuckin' this fifth, you play with me, you getting shot (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, niggas still waiting for me to drop (Uh-huh)
I robbed niggas for they base and sold easy rock (Ha)

[Verse 7: Raekwon]
Fur coats and magnums
Come through the hall with the big blammers
Bentaygas parked, let me handle this
Jewelry that's flashy, jeans is a thousand, we slick nasty
Pull out a hundred in your housing
Yeah, it's raw lingo in a Kangol
Dutch lit, nuts big as shit, taste the rainbow (Ayo, yo!)
Put your paper up and threaten shit
Or tie something up, send some messages

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, ayo, I used to tell a maid, ""Sunny side up""
Basement, a chainsaw, money tied up
Paper bag over his head, so [?] let the crocs out
Wave a whole chicken by his legs near the croc's mouth
Sweating bullets in the tip, blow torching his flesh
I seen his face melt, drip gooey shit on his chest
Watch this motherfucker beg for mercy
Shoulda let his wiz suck my dick for that time he jerked me


[Verse 9: Inspectah Deck]
The soldier I rolls with the coldest clique
Call me prototype, never had a mold to fit
My clothes is dipped, my bros is lit
Only time you been sick is when the COVID hit
Better get in line, I chop the bass like I'm pitching dimes
Code name Coffee Bean how I hit the grind
Precision design, exquisite with the vivid shine
I'm like a European watch on a different time

[Verse 10: Papoose]
I used to run around with a MAC-10
Back when I was 20 years old, that was back then (30)
30 clip in the 40, move yayo like 50
Man, I hustle like Nip in the Rolling 60s
I was born in the 70's, grew up in the 80's
Got the MAC-90, then I went crazy
Do the mathematics, y'all can't compete (100)
All by myself, I'm 100 deep

[Verse 11: Loaded Lux]
I was on the first 50, now the powers at a dollar
Politician pushing tracks in it, mayor, I president in it
Til it's humbling, think you grounded and get punished
This the second time Slay needed my two cents to keep it a hundred
How you want it? Fake and be a martyr for this matrix?
They gon turn up the AC then charge you for the blankets
Lux verse mean, got you stuck standing there
Like you at a stop sign waiting for it to turn green, what you mean?

[Verse 12: AZ]
My soul is never for sale
My youngin' just did a twelve, he home, he ringing bells
Wish him well, me and mines on different times
Decline from nigga crimes, I'm fine just spitting rhymes
Read the signs, body language is loud
Cowards hang with the crowd, I ain't never changing my style
Then and now, before that was all that
Fall back, official is what you call that

[Verse 13: Bun B]
I be that Third Coast legend, Dirty South icon
Shuttin' shit down, soon as they cut my mic on
From the first bar down to the last syllable
Niggas that thought they were immortal find out they killable
Once I see blood, I'm like a Great White
Catch you slippin' on a late night and it's no bark, straight bite
Watch you bleed out as reality starts to sink in
You tried the Triple OG (Bitch) what was you thinking?

[Verse 14: Fred the Godson]
I give the coke to your crew, the butter's crazy
Fallopian tube, just cut it baby
Gordo butterfly collar cover the Cubans
She need pads like Ewing, I hope you know what you doin' (Look)
Some paid 4-5 serious
I come through, 4-5, serious
Slay got me Shade 45 Sirius
Gold frame shades 45, Siri

[Verse 15: Jim Jones]
I used to be up in a tunnel like a hundred deep
Screamin', ""Nine Trey, Su-Woo"" with a bunch of Bs
Never tied up shoes, but every night we would run the streets
Nigga, fuck growlin', it was nights I heard my stomach speak
Then I started pumpin' that bass like they done a beat
Never let shit slide 'cause they might think somethin' sweet
Nigga, it's July, shots get hot like summer heat
When I pop up, niggas turn vegan, they never wanted beef

[Verse 16: Ransom]
I know these streets with my eyes closed, so my worst fear is to die slow
Lie low, 'cause in '05 you flipped to five-o
And I know, 'cause if Alpo did it to Rich
For some bricks, word to Flex, he had no reason to lie, po'
Aight though, we ain't gotta dwell on the past
Devilish laugh, arrow spins I'm ahead of the crash
Better to clash, when you handle your beef, settle it fast
Metal and mask but still keep an elegant class

[Verse 17: Rah Digga]
Who the greatest all time? Where them niggas reside?
I seen all fifty names, man them niggas done lied
I take the first forty-eight, make them niggas retire
Last two we could joust, make them niggas my squad
Fuck them, let's see how the ladies fare
Swerve on these bitches like I'm settin' my baby hair
They feel a type way, but they never gon' take it there
They tryna keep it cute 'cause they know that it's safer there
They wouldn't dare

[Verse 18: Billy Danze]
I can't explain what I dealt with
Know it was all weak and creep and stealth shit
When I come from under the belt with a metal shit
Forever Brownsville, numb, I never felt shit (You're as cold as ice)
I still got that real world charm, nigga, be alarmed
Body armor on, warmer in my palm (NYC)
Where you get the storm before the calm
(M.O.P.) OG and we treat it like Vietnam

[Verse 19: Lil Fame]
My generation drank forty ounces of Old English to ease the pain
Y'all niggas drink White Claws, nigga, we ain't the same (kahm-kahm)
It's curfew whenever I come through (kahm-kahm)
Kill the fuckery, them niggas can't fuck with me (come on!)
I'm really 'bout it in the war
Taxiderm' your bitch head, mount it on the wall (it's M.O.)
Throw it up, nigga, we stand tall (it's M.O.)
You know what the fuck we stand for, it's M.O

[Verse 20: Trae the Truth]
Too many niggas in here, but never follow the script
It's movie time, release the clip and have 'em doin' a flip
Off-white Virgil, need a whip with the interior Crip
On any given goal to slide, nigga, minus the slip
Checkin' niggas outta line, like it ain't nothin' to skip
Step in my section trying to flex and end up gettin' you stripped
Too many niggas watered down, might go to sinking they ship
And if it's beef, I come to trip, I never pull up and dip
It's Precious season, nigga

[Verse 21: Joell Ortiz]
Walkin' in the storm, my face had the hatred in it
Mons had the colorful money with the staples in it
Grew up street and I stay committed (Yeah)
Movin' white back and forth over green like table tennis
Guap was pourin' in, my Glock was roarin'
At nineteen, shots hit you like hydroxychloroquine
I'm still forty with the forty close
In the 840 playin' new E-40 with some horny hoes

[Verse 22: Lord Tariq]
(Yeah) Finally, y'all been waiting
To hear a verse for the economy stimulation
With Bible verses forsaken and tribal authorization
We marchin' as we awaken the mobsters across the nation
Ask doubles next to ride
The show gun with Shogun to testify
Fasho son, we hold somethin' that electrifies
N-1 L-B, no one left behind, pause it

[Verse 23: Cory Gunz]
Where I grew up in the world of Pop to give you the shot
When I vodka, the glocka Blocka! and blew the dot
You want attention? I'll give you the spot
And run up on your favorite artist aimin' at him, like, ""Do the drop""
I smack the cobble out a gobblin' blogger
Togglin' robbers with my saliva as hot as a pot of lava
And guapa, my mob has been on the sly since Yo Gabba Gabba
Trying to get the drop guava, interior baklava

[Verse 24: Peter Gunz]
Straight out the Bronx, straight off the fall
Straight off the motherfucking claw for who's settin' it off
Blocks where they spark a lot, click with the Glock a lot
Catch you at the parking lot, park you in your parking spot
Niggas know it's sex money, flex money, they do a lot
What's better than more letters and buddha spots?
Buck fifties for niggas that don't do a lot
Go ahead and get your shooter, get your shooter shot

[Verse 25: Shaquille O'Neal]
Shaq Dies', front if you want
Flow through the spirit of Kobe, I don't puff on no blunts
My estate got a shuttle, you punks
Funny thing I got places in my place I ain't discover in months (Months)
I naturally hover above 'em, I'm Kal-El
Touchdown in the arena, the crowd yell
And if they want beef, I'm ringing the cowbell
This crispy cream make 'em ring like they found Mel

[Verse 26: Roy Jones Jr.]
Jones, and I don't need no introduction
I'm the best, pound for pound, it's no discussion
Seen some mass destruction, this how I leave niggas area
Me, Shaq and Gunz, nothin' scarier
A nightmare on Elm Street when I hit the booth
A motivational speaker when I spit the truth
Come down to Pensacola if you need some proof
I could mess your smile up like a missin' tooth
Ahead of my time, but still in a league of my own
I tried to quit, but they just won't leave me alone
If you ain't got the right price, stop callin' my phone
M-mister, y'all must've forgot the king of the throne

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay & Kool DJ Red Alert]
Aw man! Ayo Kay!
Ayo what up Red Alert?
I don't think they ready for this
Well they better tool up cause I ain't done!

[Verse 27: Redman]
When you hear the shots
I'm not documenting, I'm 2Pac-umenting
I'm one of the Beatles, how I'm whippin' from that Lennon
Bye-bye, hater, real niggas winning
The 4th of July don't tell me I'm independent (Nah!)
I'm killing it, bro, my motive locomotive
Zero to ninety-nine like my Netflix loaded (Get em'!)
Telling your boss brick city boys is fire
Never mind, half of y'all be talking through the wire

[Verse 28: Young Buck]
Media slandered me, so that's why I'm slayin' you niggas
Never knew what hit him, got the doctor X-rayin' you niggas
Turned you to a victim, man, I sprinkle some yay' on you niggas
They thinkin' it's drug-related, gotta weigh on you niggas
All on the radio with the beef, got 'em sweatin' like they was Keith
And it's never gonna be peace, I'm shooting up your album release
Baggin' bricks with your niece, come and get you a piece
I'm taking responsibility for the murder increase, it's Buck

[Verse 29: MC Serch]
Kay wanted me to be one of the buck because I been a buck
Back when a pack of Newports was a buck, I was a young buck
On the corner of Monarch, kids from Far Rock hoppin' over the turnstile
To set up shop up top by the Jamaican spot
My joints have been a bop, from vinyl, cassettes, CDs and streams
On every Martin Luther Boulevard, they payin' homage to the shooter from Queens
Right now you wanna be this cracker from Queens
Fact though, I'm covered from special fleece to my Wallaby Supremes

[Verse 30: Big Daddy Kane]
This one image is unblemished without one gimmick
Your line of scrimmage, I cross it in one sentence
The core writer for those that lost sight
Of the promenade, now heed the words of the poor righteous
That build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
But y'all know math was in me for the past half a century
Now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
Cause I want the smoke, charcoal, and lighter fluid

[Verse 31: MC Shan]
Talk shit, but I could back up game
The way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same
How you wouldn't hesitate to kill, buck, rack, attack
Ask him if he said to Shan, he said, ""FUCK THAT!""
Bullshit, I'm not the one to get with
Pressure gets so violent, givin' a fuck what I hit
I play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
And I sing it like a pussy that's this deep

[Verse 32: KRS-One]
KRS is big and scary
I'm that legend, getting cream, legendary
Hear me, I rocked this, shocked this, hip-hop this
I woke and I wake up, these rappers are not this
The hotness, I would knock some of these rappers out
But you can hear they already unconscious
I got this, on the top list, fake, I'm not this
Temple of Hip-Hop, rising to the top, kid

[Verse 33: Jon Connor]
Every verse is a persecution, it's murder music
You get cursed, the room is like army, they get the hearses movin'
Fire shit, you get burned and ruined, it's burnin' fuses
Bunch of designer, heard a human loses, deserve these bruises (Go)
Nobody tellin' me that it could ever be somebody better
I got a vendetta, I mean every word, every letter
Ahead of my time and you know not to ever put me in position
Designed to put these rappers out of commission
All I spit is dope and after this, y'all gon' need intervention
Taking it back to that driving ambition

[Verse 34: Twista]
Look up to Twista how I be killing 'em like I'm in Wimbledon
I make a sweep when I'm doing the murdering
I put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
Minimum damage I would never do, I dead 'em like a barbiturates
Omnivorous with the flow, it don't matter which bar I bit you with
I could reorganize the confusion of a child Pharaoh
Now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
Hmm, I am approaching so I hope you're using a radar
Causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

[Verse 35: Drag-On]
Itchy trigger finger, watch me finger fuck it, niggas bust and
Squeeze the biscuit, hit him in his English muffin, repercussion
Call the homies, niggas spray the corner, now they fallin'
On the white sheet and bars, drag rappers by they wife beater
Drama King told me ""Drag, go stupid,"" so Imma go stupid
Made this fitted cap a drop top, almost mini couped it
Stick shift, automatic, automatic big clip, round clip
Hit a nigga while I downshift, yeah

[Verse 36: Chris Rivers]
It's me again, all I be is when, never if
If you see a lens, it's probably CNN or a gif
I could rat-a-tatter, your brain matter get scattered
And served up on a platter, they call it data, baiting cappers
I'm more like Beta Kappa, I'm great like your great great grandma
And they wanna protect with this Great Lake grammar
It's Rivers, that's why I gotta be called, decide if you fall
Or have to wear a thought or break a side of the law
And fight for yours

[Verse 37: Nino Man]
We a hundred deep, don't give a fuck 'bout your capacity
They tell me who they favorite, I ain't hatin' but they trash to me
Y'all know this my world so I'ma hold it down like gravity
I'm bitin', that's a casualty, I'm blowin' out your cavities
Keep a pocket rocket for the people pocket watchin'
Pull up with a Glock and cock it, got you beggin' not to pop it
Y'all gotta stop, I want more cash and more fast
I went on a run like I'm all gas from all bad

[Verse 38: Locksmith]
You're dealing with a locksmith, my mindset is too meticulous
Rhymes melt when I sing like the wings from Kid Icarus
Every rap is indicative, diction is like a diction
I'm ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that I stitched in
You're pitching garbage, each comment is like a gauntlet
A conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
Ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
Intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

[Verse 39: 3D Na'Tee]
I don't smoke but stay with a cig like Mary-Kate Olsen
'Cause my patience short as D Brees or DeRozan
I ain't a Fashion Nova model that swallow rappers for follows
Just for mentions on blogs with flaws like it Apollo
But keep the toolie, pockets blue like Tookie, patience short as Uzi
You a groupie, you a rat like Mickey, you look like a goofy
Out your kufi, yeah you out your top, thinkin' you gon' move me
You like Sookie, you suck dick for chips, I'm too rich and choosy, bitch

[Verse 40: Trick Trick]
I ain't gotta tell you what I've done, who I am or where I'm from
If you don't know it by now then you just dumb
I ain't got no pistols, inf beams, choppers or no Dracos
No car, no girlie, beams or no bankrolls
I buy shares, land, LLCs and payrolls
Kuwaiti and Bahraini dinar, gold bouillon
Mutual funds, nigga, fuck a dollar and a peso
I got seven investors that'll invest when I say so

[Verse 41: Tragedy Khadafi]
Hey yo, max eight lines, I wrote this spinning a yarn though
Foul mind, the villainous Queens, Lance Feurtado
Mean face Murcielago, over god flows
Salute that, shit on schedule like it's Jumu'ah
I don't do the work, I just stuff bags to pass shooters
Let the foreign skirt, squeeze semi and let it squirt
All the facts, all the chow now, getting rich off of merch
Laser beams, I done turn niggas' Foamposites to red bottoms

[Verse 42: E-A-Ski]
Yeah I'm underrated and I never sold my soul
And I never switched slang to sound southern when the game changed
Niggas say they real, til you see 'em on the real
Then you find out they a bitch ass nigga, just with a record deal
For real, the internet gon' get these niggas killed
Hide behind that keyboard cuz, gon' make some blood spill
Your insecurity gon' make this .45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
And then you'll have more clarity

[Verse 43: Cassidy]
If I roll a hundred deep, it's two hundred fists, two hundred feet
At least a hundred guns so every nigga get one apiece
Bitch, I'll piss on the tombstone you underneath
This sick, don't play this shit if your stomach weak
I can stomach beef, I done faced danger
I squeeze like a waist trainer then you will lose stomach meat
I run the streets, so when Cass scheme, that mean
They gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

[Verse 44: Bumpy Knuckles]
Out of sight, out of mind, til I creep up behind
Double barrel shots you out, everything on your mind
Figure that, like the next line you tryna consider
But you careful so you dumb down, you ain't no spitter
Then you post, you got beef, tell me you ain't no hitter
You a tweeter, who mouth flame more than his heater
From the days of the park jams, blowin' the tweeters
Rugged raps with a DJ cut in the meetings

[Verse 45: Gillie the King]
G-G-Get 'em!
Let me give you facts, before CashApp
I was frontin' niggas workin', they was bringing cash back
Before Instagram was selling up instant grams
Connect 'em and I can never fuck with no middle man
Before the fake jewelry and niggas with all the cappin'
40 karats in my Philly, this nigga was all platinum
Huh? You little niggas in the way
This million dollar payday's me and my nigga Kay Slay

[Verse 46: Ice-T]
It's the West Coastin', New Yorkin', low-ridin', Crip-walkin' nigga
Anyone can get it, masked like the pandemic
Niggas mad I don't pick up, I got multiple phones
Slay took a month to find me, got multiple homes
Pop off, my black talons will bullet your vest
(Gun noises) 300 blackout, fully suppressed
Cut through your cold crew like a saw blade
Then up at Mr. Chow's eatin' saute

[Verse 47: Treach]
Jersey Journal, where the next signal infernal
And eat chicken with friction before I try 'em, kidnap the colonel
Trigger title, trigger finger, trigger treacherous
Double shots of extortion, exercise to an exorcist
Exercise my freedom, beat 'em when I leave 'em, eat 'em
Even when the odds ain't even, I get even
With Kay Slay, fuck they play, the rebirth and replay
Mr. Slap-Your-Favorite-DJ, this all has changed on eBay
It's Jers'!

[Verse 48: Kool G Rap]
Top billing how we Gizmo and Milk shit
Grimy crimies, did all the dirt and the filth with
Yeah, my young buck days was on the real strip
Fillmore Slim shit, straight off a film strip
I ran through more fine women than Wilt did
Superstars, chem fills bitches with some soft and silk lips
Made a killing off of dealing that real fix
Numbers like a pinball wizard, tilly-tilt shit

[Verse 49: Lil Cease]
I'm the product of Frank White
Whoever acting tough gets stage frights
Getting clearer visions of grave sights
So get my cake right, something in the bake and it ain't light
Or something in your face and it ain't life
So don't play with me, Hell gates await
When I come to the 8th, I shoot it faithfully
And tell Mitch to pray for me
Slay with the AK nigga, that's my speciality
Brooklyn forever, M.A.F.I.A 'til the death of me

[Verse 50: RJ Payne]
Look, for my next verse I done left Earth
The internet done triple my net worth off a sweatshirt
Expert, I let the TECs work, your neck chirp
Been a devil, bench press metal, I'm doin' chest work
One of the deepest, see you've been warned
Please believe you're now lookin' at Jesus in human form
I'm Jet Li, respect me like you speakin' to Scooter Braun
The newest legend in the league, I lead with my shootin' arm
It's Payne

[Verse 51: JR Writer]
All you assholes finished, I don't have those limits
You'll get this work in all black, it's a black-owned business
But you cats don't get it, that's why I'm stunting on you newbies
Your father was a super fan, your mother was a groupie
That's why I trip like, ""Who you tryna rap with?""
Sounding nothing like yourself, who you tryna catfish?
Like you bodied that shit, shut your lying ass lips
Do I look like I been playing nigga? Colin Kaepernick, motherfucker

[Verse 52: Shoota 93]
You got the memo, murder game is my M.O. (Fact though)
Lurk the frontline, not from out of the window (No!)
Take a life, then take your jewels for a memento
You make it to the outro, you got to pay for the intro
Like a nympho, ain't fuckin' around, I ain't (I'm not)
Shoota a sure shot, like a D in the paint
Don't need a long stick, just a .38, I'm straight
One dome shot, that's how I show restraint (Shoota!)

[Verse 53: Ms. Hustle]
They like damn we ain't heard from you in a minute
Shit get great from my present see bitch I'm gifted
They said it's only right they callin' me cold see I'm the sickest
I heard it just like Curse of the Lottery you hoes is scripted
Don't get it twisted me and you was a difference
I'm a superstar you role playin' bitches is pimpin'
Oh and did I mention, keep me up out your mentions
You bitches ain't soldiers y'all just be wantin' attention

[Verse 54: Vado]
Hey yo New York, get the money, five boroughs of death
My dude was called, where's the money, fire, birds and meth (Hey!)
Hood Bunny, Bugs Bunny, Iceberg, and Sweats
First baguettes, Big Stepper learn the steps
Earn respect with connects 'cause my word was kept (Yes!)
Swerve the 'Vette like Sean Paul for more medicine
Fur gon' slip, like I don't spit, burn the blessed
The truth, 2Pac jewels like I serve them wet
Vado!

[Verse 55: Mysonne]
This homicide was prophesized before I was a toddler's size
Any job nigga, I am overqualified
I'm the kind of nigga whose cloth it be hard to find
Integrity? I put mine over dollar signs
A nigga play me, then he out his mind
As long as my niggas is winnin', I ain't gotta shine
If you can't see I'm a G, then you kinda blind
Die 'fore you disrespect me, nigga, bottom line

[Verse 56: Mistah F.A.B.]
Return of the barbaric barbarian bar spitter
Bar 9 bar guns ballin' like bar mitzvah
You bar 9 your bars done I'm Barific
My bars gifted real rapper my bars Christmas
Cooked like a bar & grill I spit these bars in your grill
Homer bluehead keep a mag I'm Bart Simpson
My bars mention muscle bars I'm bar benchin'
Ted Danson have a beer and cheer these bars pimpin'

[Verse 57: Saigon]
I see these niggas flex as if I ain't one of the best at this
And wonder why I'm attacking the mic like a pessimist
My name should be next to excellence, bless the globe
With the pestilence, like methodin', and put in work like a Mexican
A record for killin' tracks, somethin' like John Gotti
What he have, like 19? I just caught 99 bodies
Slay, I'm sorry, I know this hip-hop camaraderie
But since nobody bodied me, don't accept my apology

[Verse 58: Melle Mel]
Stop chasing props niggas, top niggas march
By the cops, followed hot blocks, they pop niggas
I ain't one of you niggas, I'm a pair of Gators
You a pair of Uggs, you ugly but you comfortable nigga
I'm the OG, pre-Cardi nigga, the diamond in the back
Cadillac black, Pretty Ricky, Maserati nigga
The god-body, rock a party nigga
That can socially distance your head from your motherfuckin body nigga

[Verse 59: Grandmaster Caz]
I'm so Bronx, nigga, my middle name is Jonas
BX microphonist, also known as
The Bronx bomber, comma, hip-hop's Barack Obama
Osama, Dalai Lama, either way gon' be some drama
I'm the one even your momma fall for
I'm droppin' the bat and take it first nigga ball four
I'm roundin' the bases while niggas trip over they shoelaces
With they screwfaces, mic broke in two places

[Verse 60: Havoc]
100 deep, know how we roll
Find where a nigga sleep, blowing out peepholes
Nothing never been sweet but we icy cold
Put a price on niggas' head for that shit you said
Got back so we boomerang, watch what you say
Hot shit'll spray, in a box you will lay
Know the Mobb be the gang with the Drama King
Always gonna hold it down, that's what I promised P

[Verse 61: Tracey Lee]
I did it, y'all forgot, I'm still with the scripture
Every bar has a plot and these lines are configurate
The mind over mine over mind over the pendant
I am signing on the plot I will put 'em in the blender
A dope spitter with a pro black agenda
Supported by the black referendum
And this only a sliver of the splendor
Homie it's the sensei
A dope boy with a flow no lo contendere

[Verse 62: E.D.I. Mean]
They told me pussy and paper go together like problems and pistols
I'm a problem to pussies who want to play with my issue
I'm pullin' rappers close, that shit you wrote was half-ass
I'm way past first class, laugh when your hearse pass
I Kill 'em with kindness, King EDI the highest
Me, Noble, Slay, you can see we the flyest
We load the spray, pussy niggas retire
100 deep, now you can watch us rise up

[Verse 63: Young Noble]
When 'Rock the Bells' dropped, I was locked into hip hop
Fresh off the porch with my brother Sean's boom box
Around the same time when I heard Illmatic
I was on my block, sellin' long dimes to the addicts, yeah
I remember back when Rae dropped the purple tape
We was young Outlawz, tryna raise the murder rate
Me against the world when I first heard Doggystyle
Still screamin' ""Fuck the world, doggystyle""

[Verse 64: McGruff]
No more mumble rap, back to that boom bap
No cap, I'm in the trap where the goons at
Peace to all my niggas up top, getting them lunes back
Salute to the brother of me and my nigga Loon back
Harlem World's finest, let's be honest
You don't gotta give me dap, nigga, just pay homage
Peep my steps, always keep the piece on deck
I'm from the danger zone where we handle beef by death, nigga

[Verse 65: Stan Spit]
Everybody's an opp, plenty bodies'll drop
Slay hit me up, told me body the block
Go ape the whole eight, no way they hold weight
They so fake, okay? I won't play, ya don't say?
Kay shit, basic when they spit
Face it, we not only the zone, we the matrix
Your algorithm rhythm off balance
I'm 'bout to start the ""We don't care if you die"" challange

[Verse 66: Sickflo]
Live from the Wire but I reside in the A
You admire the attire, I am sighin' today
No Jaden but I'm Lord Raiden
Show you with all the cadence
Lightning in my tips, with these scripts, I'm full paid in
And what a great game in heaven, boosted my cranium
Bars became za induced with titanium
Stars beyond Mars, the truth, I'm so empty
With six spliffs in the booth, it hits like Vibranium

[Verse 67: Fredro Starr]
Ayo Kay Slay, we can't let the BS slide
The game ain't been the same since DS died
Got five niggas jumping out the GS5
Will leave my gun smoking like a PS5
DS5 the street rap, somebody tell me where the streets at
This that shit to make the heat clap
From my niggas selling cheap packs
Them niggas keep straps, the Onyx is the kings of that street rap

[Verse 68: Sticky Fingaz]
It is Sticky, don't make me put my hands on you
Nigga, I could tell you what each one of my fingers do
My pinky finger, that's with the pink ring at
And my ring finger, never put a ring on that
And my middle finger? That's how I feel about that
I use my index finger to make that thing clap
And my thumb, I ain't got a use for that
So I put it in a bitch ass while I fuck her from the back

[Verse 69: Ras Kass]
What you lames claim is relevant ain't
The culture's five elements, felons pistol whip your pelican vapes
I shoulda named the metal Baretta the Drake
Givin' em back to back hits 'til your skeleton breaks
Yo take a new era super head in my Wraith
Givin' me fitted call it the 7 and 1-8
Each one of my bars smoke ya whole 16
How you trap in your mom's necklace and wear big jeans?

[Verse 70: Termanology]
I ace the motherfuckin' track like a pro's supposed to
I'm blowin' up in this bitch, you know, Apollonia
And anytime I did a rhyme, I did it for the culture
The doctor said I need a culture, I might have the 'rona
I beat the shit and now I'm like a hundred times stronger
Run for the block and flippin' rocks to a stock holder
Hold my composure, bring my hand up when the shots over
A hundred deep with the soldiers, and we shoulder to shoulder

[Verse 71: DJ Doowop]
Yo, I live a DJ's dream, hearin' fans scream
Cash in my hand green, they wanted to ban me
'Cause most of it was tax free, at last, me and Slay connect
Niggas know the outcome
We got mixtapes with features better than your album
Bounce Master with the Street Sweeper
For you heat seekers and them double D cup ladies and IG divas
My mixtape gave your boyfriend power
Holla at me when y'all got my flowers (Bounce)

[Verse 72: Junior Reid]
I'm Junior Reid, I run these streets
Killin' all these hip-hop beat
Hey, I just can't be defeat
One blood family, we came here to eat
Murder!
When I roll, you know I roll deep
My hand stay strong and you know we don't cheat
Trap for the money and you know we don't sleep

[Verse 73: Oun P]
If it's beef and we don't make up after talkin'
It's a high chance you gon' be wearing makeup in the coffin
I think of Busta Rhymes the way that the cops flamin' us
Like ""put your hands where I can see before it get dangerous""
Fuck twelve and whoever gave 'em information
State property parties, you want a invitation?
You don't wanna do that, family
Them people gon' have to move your family, it ain't a movie y'all

[Verse 74: Merkules]
You woke up a sleeping giant, there's no one breathing this fire
It's me, I'm known globally mostly for being violent
I'm closing up both of your eyelids cause no one seeing me rhyming
Fuck quarantine, I'm outside, I'm a morbid beast on the mic
These are more than schemes that I'm writing
It's for the fiends and the piper
New cocoa leaf, it ain't Pyrex, hoping that they don't die next
Shoutout to street sweeper, I breathe ether, my team G'd up
The streets need us like cheap heaters and clean sneakers

[Verse 75: Wais P]
Wais P, you should have gave me the whole song (Why?)
'Cause I'm doper than the shit Demi Lovato overdosed on
Put a ho on every corner you post on, poison potion
Give you my life on every track that I spoke on
Blow bullets 'til the barrel is hot enough to cook coke on
Phasers photon, never on stun, give you the whole drum
Wanna know why I'm on the second run? I go dumb
Plus a hundred rounds beats fifty in any gun

[Verse 76: Maino]
I can spot the lies in they lines, what lines in they eyes
Is fear, you hear? A coward cries when he dies
I was down now I'm up, they surprised by my rise
I've been out, fresh fade, bitches thought that I was Nas
Lord please forgive me, I'm a sinner
Sweat suits, gold ropes swinging like a 80s dope dealer
Trust me, I get iller, underneath the chinchilla
The street sweeper, Kay Slay with a hundred killers

[Verse 77: Uncle Murda]
Always been disrespectful, never been polite
Slay got me on the record with a bunch of niggas I don't like (I really don't though)
Them niggas corny, and their verses is not hard
Probably like ten rappers on this record that I got robbed
I'm the truth, I'm just realizing my worth
Niggas gon' turn this shit off after they hear my verse (I don't blame 'em)
And fuck whoever feel disrespected
Niggas gon' be mad Kay Slay put me on this record (Ah)

[Verse 78: PT Capone Mobstyle]
The best ever, bulletproof, the vest leather
Head shot, talkin' big bags of cheddar
Harlem, we run shit, you fags sleep
Cemetery, last stop, your bag's deep
Six feet, gun and a mask, my team creep
Mausoleum, you can see 'em, your team's sleep
Harlem, mob style, we run shit
Sheet rock, bury niggas for dumb shit

[Verse 79: Tony Starks]
Grenades, bombs and rocket launchers
The smell of dead bodies, the odor comes back to haunt ya
Gucci vests from Dapper Dan, mountains of blow on a glass table
Look like a goddamn avalanche
Construction bags of snow, one scale
One doctor just in case your blood pressure fail
We got diesel, weed, coke and lean by the pail
Two phones next to that old bitch out in Wales

[Verse 80: Mike Cee]
Show a sign, force on the course, it's authentic
You cross the sauce, try to be boss, get lost in it
That's a early retirement, call it a forced finish
Fuck a Porsche with horse, I put your horse with Porsche in it
Nigga Mike Cee, syllable, syllabicate
Syllabicate, it's so real, realize, realization
Realization, realize, real
S-Syllabicate, s-syllabicate, syllables, Mike Cee

[Verse 81: Royal Flush]
I swear to God if I die tonight, I'm taking a few niggas with me
My little man just came home doing 5 so I gave him 50
I ain't gave his Dior back meaning I got this Llama with me
Run Scott my papers 50 sellin' bricks I don't fuck with dizzies
Keep a lot of shooters outside it's gon be hard to clip me
Before I surrender to God and Mississippi
Got these bitches being my mule to get some bigger titties
Falling cost me 260 got another 60 with me

[Verse 82: Super Lover Cee]
Fuck y'all, thought I better talk, caught up a narrative
I sat back watching you tryna figure what bag it is
Imagine if I came back, Super Lover with savages
And put a tilting was building change the average of marriages
Cause she's still after me due to audio in audacity
For cardio and the tune grooving room at capacity
When parties over, we boom boom, for you it's gravity
A tragedy, by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

[Verse 83: Page Kennedy]
You could have a hundred verses from my hundred persons
But this one emerges
And it's curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of Birkin
Detroit is a mindset, as soon as the verse ends, you rewind it
Knowing that the Drama King was behind it
I'm Page Kennedy don't let the last man escape
Get your ass kicked by a movie star that looks more like an asterisk
Get your bifocal lens
You a fighter that wouldn't even punch vocals in

[Verse 84: Rockness]
I spit stupid, you just stupid
Don't even walk off your porch, you should just stoop it
You too bitch for this goon shit, it ain't just music
We shoot you and jam to your death, no Rick Rubin
Yo my gun blow drumroll, til it unload
Or til the gun broke, then punch holes through a chump's soul
I'm muggin', it's just jokes, I'm friendly and shit
Get higher it's the highway to heaven, I'll send you a lift

[Verse 85: Gunplay]
(Gunplay) 7.62s, nigga never left clues
Crib looking like a motherfuckin evidence room
And I keep a street sweeper, nothing less than this broom
And that's only when I'm in a fuckin excellent mood
I got four nine-pieces on a four-door panel
Louis open-toed sandals, overdose on those samples
Living legend in the 'jects, nigga daddy every threat
Homie died in his holster, got the weapon, never left

[Verse 86: Sadat X]
The pandemic got niggas searching for endemic
You either win or you a dub, fuck the club, don't get it fucked up
It's still paid for the bin
And you just gotta find a fucking way in
Now we gonna see who's a boss
And rise above the COVID or take a fucking loss
Wear the mask or don't, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still get a buck and a gold medal, I will never settle

[Verse 87: Grand Puba]
I be the block (Dynamite) so hit the sheets to the streets
Like playing games with Jamar's will beat your feet
I'ma drop a straight 8 for my nigga Kay's beat
We go back like Fat Jack my nigga Harlem heat
Got bodies for a throttle smashing King Midas
Put the drip in the game drop jewels and pop bottles
I'm valedictorian ask any historian
I'm back from streets you pullin' up in that Delorean

[Verse 88: Lord Jamar]
I'ma keep the knowledge, yeah, two cyphers
(Keep it a hundred) Lord J and Kay Slay, that's two triflers
We roll deep when we hold heat
Stay away or get sprayed with a new virus
They manufactured a new crisis
With plans to capture your third iris
I stand with the stature of the bird ibis
I'm like Dawoodi when I'm doing my duty (facts)

[Verse 89: Sonja Blade]
I'm from where Big and Hov came Pop Smoke cocaine
Rope slayin' over coats and them dope rope chains
Bed-Stuy Veteran fella been ridin'
Better than I've ever been America's bidin'
Harris no comparison since
So don't let that fly shit go to your head like Mike Pence
I got seniority Francis Sorority
Sonja Blade bitch just respect my athority

[Verse 90: Coke La Rock]
Lets take it back to the essence where it all began (Yeah)
Hip-hop, the original man (C'mon)
First emcee ain't my claim to fame
'Cause I been getting money, ain't a damn thing changed
I'm Coke La Rock and I'm still on the scene (Let's go)
The true OG to the culture you're in (Okay)
Bronx legend, respect the crown
And pay homage where it started, we call it the Boogie Down

[Verse 91: Greg Nice]
I'm from the era catching cabs on Broadway
Put 'em on hold, ride around town all day
Way before the Uber and a Lyft it was OJ
Do the kickstep, man, just like Kid Play
We're on the east side like DJ Kay Slay
Smoke your chronic up, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre
Sprinkle my man, E-40, he from the bay
Yo I say butter man and you say Parkay

[Verse 92: Smooth B]
Smooth B kick shit Pelé like soccer
You that man in the middle, cockblocker
I been a G, never been a sucker
I don't hide, never scared, not a ducker
Above the Rim like I'm in Harlem at the Rucker
Motherfucker, I'm thorough with this
I ring bells around the world every borough with this

[Verse 93: Consequence]
Always had the bands like Coi Leray
So I'm young enough to relate to the YouTubers
Old enough to still date a few cougars
Yet the struggle became a weapon for me
So success became a separate story
But them cheques, got 'em checkered for me
Shit, I'm shooting from Steph' territory
And I get more love than Diddy's license
We rollin' a hundred deep, and I'm the city's nicest

[Verse 94: Millyz]
Look, I'm Tommy Egan in the Honda weaving
Leave your Mama grieving for the non-believing
On the deacon, Dominican mommy ganja steaming
Bomb with demons that'll take your chain and go to pond to peacing
I quit trapping cause my music is dope
You might've saw me in the lane but I'm truly the goat
You try to tell him calm down, bro was doing the most
They left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

[Verse 95: OT the Real]
I trap with the guys knowing I'ma capitalize
But slaps I'ma drive to DC those capital rides
Put rappin' aside I got yak and captions to buy
She smashin' up lines so big they look like capital I's
We back in the times so start us here you back in the pines
Snap but I'm fine the Henny and the gas intertwine
I smash and I grind got the work stashed with the 9
I'm where they'll put you on a shirt like a fasion design

[Verse 96: Ron Artest]
Yo!
You from the hood Uptown Queens New York
Save the milk cereal with the fork
Scraped the plate and now get the fuck out my way
We on the grind yes I got a lot on my mind
Back in the days I used to wanna punch them in face
I changed my ways and now I just wanna get paid
Smoking haze out a trombone Nicholas Cage
Fire tire is burning times is turning

[Verse 97: Kaflow]
Kaflow Kaboom rolling a hundred deep
Ever since a young wolf, I always hunted sheep
I already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
Seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
I'm from the streets where they brag about puttin' you underneath
A lot of niggas gon' get shot before the summer reach
Take you to the balcony, hang you from your feet
My office hours are from nine to five, not from one to three

[Verse 98: Tone Trump]
A living legend like Slay on The Box
The big dime baby I'm like Jay to the opps
Purple Coogi Purple Tape I'm like Rae to the opps
When it time it ain't the mink then i'm playin' the fox
I'm sorry king of these Pradas and not Adidas
NDF We the mob and I'm the leader free the opps
Fear the law, get money, and flee the cops
Fuck the judge fuck the feds cause they the opps

[Verse 99: Hocus 45th]
Sickening, street smart but the flow ignorant
Henchmen, but never wear no Jimmy when I'm hittin' it
Big up to the game, bookstores, no more memberships
Shout out to the cub and Dior, free the innocent
Outlaw, live by often, I would die for
I get all the blame, someone get shot, they say it's my fault
So when they talk, I just pay 'em never mind
Cause when I spot em, I'ma dot em like the letter I

[Verse 100: Omar Epps]
I'm Toussaint Louverture, unfamiliar? Google more
Gurkha out the humidor, wise man who fool 'em all
Prove 'em wrong, told Kay Slay I would do the song
Move along if you ain't about that communion, dawg
Through the fog and darkness, the world be in peril
'Til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
I'm blessed, not pressed but I'm vexed, the game culture
Brothers obeyin' other suckers who ain't of us
We reppin' that red, black and green, that's a thing
Like Pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
The latter means I saw a lot, Earth a tourist spot
Still we universal beings, this rehearsal VN
P.S., we turn T-shirts to tuxedos
With flowers from the mall with no GMOs or cheat codes
The power is in lovin' the death of your own ego
O.E. go, that's that Brooklyn

[Verse 101: Bodega Bamz]
Who really the best rapper since Pun ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Bamz in here
The most underrated, the most hated, the most doing the most
The most almost famous, the most favorite
Bodega getting them chips again, what happened?
First class back from Switzerland, no capping
I'm the voice they wanna silence, who said it's late?
It's perfect timing
Load up the Uzi, headshot, take the diamond

[Verse 102: Bynoe]
In the car with 2 blicks them shits got 3 attempts on it
You gon be the first full body
Toe tag zip em up the doc won't stitch em up
Sucka ass niggas been lollipops
Spin the block twice won't leave til a body drop
My influence in the hood is impeccable
Stir fry something turn a nigga to a vegetable
*gunshot sounds*
Hello!

[Verse 103: PTKNY]
It's P dot T dot K nigga
I'm back looking for drama I'm here to slay niggas
NYC tryna be A niggas
Blatant only way you figured out to get paid nigga
And let them niggas have they own style
And act like you niggas really from home
You know that where they shit was grown
And leave that drill shit alone too
Before the shot gets to drilling you
Nigga!

[Verse 104: Aobie]
These rappers hoein' now, doin' anything to get papes
Even my DMs like a bitch to do a mixtape
I be killin' shit, I need a sponsorship from Ruger
Been ahead of my time, it's like I rhyme from the future
If niggas want trouble, homie, the trouble suit us
Ran up on you snakes, got me feeling like Medusa
They say they from the Bay, I'm nowhere specific
But those that don't know, nigga it's a difference

[Verse 105: King Kirk]
It's getting real hard to eat, no time to argue
Blow a driveway through your chest, let it park you
The broads done rip apart you
Sunset dark you, leave you hard to recharge, it'll restart you
No cinema like our own theatre scarier
Big Dubez, King Kirk, Brando, three of the thieves
Period, lyricists, storytellin'
Cordelen, split your fuckin' watermelon

[Verse 106: Big Dubez]
4D! I go up top they take enough shots (enough shot)
Now I'm home, we see what's up then (home now)
Let you tell it, you Teddy Bruckshot
All I'm hearing is Teddy Ruxpin
Trust and believe, sleep on the D's
Get tough then, mics, I crush them
Causin' disruption, we talkin' a tusslin'
Figure four rap, nigga, fuck all the fussin'
End of discussion

[Verse 107: Tony Moxberg]
I been livin' on the road for the past week (For real)
Makin' more moves than an athlete (Uh huh)
I'm from the backstreets where they pack heat
I deliver, got more drop offs than a taxi
Hated by the ones who love, shit's weird
I been seein' six figures for like six years
Young boy goin' dumb and he 'bout to go dumber
Two sticks on him, he think he a drummer

[Verse 108: Styleon]
A fist up for black people, our lives matter
Like your life, but my life, they won't understand it
Traumatic stress on my hands, this is from being captured
Mutilated like castration, part of them chapters
But this a never ending story, them pages continue
My shade part of that food chain minus the menu
It's deeply rooted in genetics, the past that we've been through
Original Hebrew, got me feelin' it sacrificial

[Verse 109: Chuck D]
I got the power I'm putting in, punching the clock like the '99
'89 before that seventy-five
When I was around and I first rhymed
While many searched hard for punchlines
I had some that you cannot find
Had some that you can't rehearse
All I had to do was voice a verse, the Kay Slay show

[Verse 110: Sauce Money]
Fuck chill, I think it's time that people really know
What's real, nobody else get to spin it
I know these haters won't condone, everything I own
Pointed at the throne, and I don't care who's sittin' in it
Bank on that, nobody son trust
After the clashes and the ashes come dust
You came for the fame, you gotta do what one must
But me, I'm only here to eradicate the unjust
Real talk, motherfuckers the worst
They ain't grow into fuck niggas, they were suckers from birth
Rub shoulders and then it's over, you touch 'em you cursed
I can't wait to put love in reverse
The verse woulda been iller if it wasn't for Slay
He said ""'Sau it's for the culture, not today""
I said ""Cool, and usually you're always right
But just remember culture vultures ain't always white""

[Outro: DJ Kay Slay]
DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
Rolling 110 deep
That's right!
It had to be done!
Everything revolves 360°
What comes around goes around
Bring it back to the talent over popularity
Start talkin' to the people
Instead of about the people
Don't test me
You fuck around next time
I do rolling 200 deep on you motherfuckers!",en,"Trackateering Music Man, y'all did it with this one here, y'all People love to use that quote, ""I'm doin' it for the culture"" But what culture is that that you're talking about? The one that you claim as a hip-hop artist But won't do the research on hip-hop history Or the one where you disrespect, disconnect And disregard the founding fathers? But you know what?

Floating down, through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream

Goodbye, Max, Goodbye, Ma
After the service, when you’re walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!

[Verse 2]
(“Oi!”) A place to stay, Enough to eat (“Over here, Morris! Get back! Get back, John!”)
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what’s more, no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don’t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore
Night after night
Going round and round, my brain
His dream is driving me insane

But give me time , I'll make her smile and pull all those numbers in

I never thought that this is what it would come to
In the middle of the desert in the midday sun
You with a shovel and me with a gun

Remember you asked me if I trusted you?
You said “Babe, if you trust me, I’ll make your dreams come true”
“All you gotta do” you said “is watch the door”
Then you walked in the diner and yelled “everybody hit the floor”

You broke my innocence and you stole my pride
You took my emotions on a daredevil ride
You told me you loved me, that was a boldfaced lie
But you got what you wanted, you made the innocent cry

This thing it went as well as these things go
“Gimme all your money” you say and they do as they’re told
But the girl behind the counter, she was calm and cool
See, I was looking at her when she smiled at you and then I knew

But baby this is not my first rodeo
Before you came to town I was a one-man show
Did you really think that I would take the fall
You two lovebirds, you don’t know me at all

I didn’t want to have to have this talk with you
And it’s funny that this is what it would come to
No I didn’t want to have to hear you plead for your life
I just wanted you to listen as I told you why


Why I broke her innocence and why I stole her pride
Why I took her emotions on a daredevil ride
And she told me she loved you and boy that is why

Let's see where to go from here, hey
Sippin' on the, uh, seven' on the first, yeah
Back with the-

[Verse 1]
Seven on the first roll, man they try to say I'm luckin' up
Styles on styles, flip molds like bus a bus
I'ma roll a backwood for the dawgs
If it ain't about the play, put that shit on pause
We do this every day, stack large ammounts
I see you workin' out on your Instagram account
I like 'em thick
I get you stompin' on Mercedes pedals if it's slick
No rose petals, I might show up with some hand
And some killzone for my cousin then
Still remember my first time touchin' ten
Now when they get to the gate, gotta buzz 'em in

[Chorus]
Nothing like the Menace to Society, Chauncy
Used to stay two exits from the waterman, swap me
Niggas out they fuckin' mind, who ain't got beats?
Told my main squeeze I got you if you got me
Hey, yeah, uh
I got you if you got me
Hey, yeah, look
I got you if you got me


[Verse 2]
Me and Jansport got slap like Ike Turner
Gunnin' like YG's when they get they first burner
Push the grey Honda Accord, when I got my learners
Check the calibers now, they money green
Like bad actin' I'm fuckin' up the scene
All attracting no chasing
No Tyrese, I'm Waist Deep
Ask them niggas how they hate me
Took major risks and it got 'em pissed
I'm 10 out of 10 when it come to solidness
You ever put some tints in the back of a lift
Seem the addy got 'em pullin' up to the crib
Even when I had to [?] the bucket
I ain't cared too much, I knew this shit was comin'
The nigga in me got me blowin' hundreds
Got some [?], that shit was humblin'

Gun powder in my clothing, load the clip then unload it
We the realest you can quote me
I'm back and I'm better brodie
Made this beat all by my lonely
Wrote this shit all by lonely
So I'm doly to the stu, I might be the one and only
9 hunnid dollar tee and a two tone Rollie
Two hands up, niggas tryna block me like a goalie
Thugs and parole, some of my closest homies
It's the way these niggas move why we ain't clickin'
They fakin' real life, get saved by image
I'm sizin' niggas up but this ain't full fittin'
I can hear the sneak diss in the play back
Niggas will see me, one on one to say that
The injection is lethal, I'm thumpin on the needle
Put my face on stain glass in the cathedral
Back to back deals with Jimmy and Hovito
Niggas wouldn't know the feeling
Building till I own the building, yeah

[Interlude 1: Hit-Boy]
I'd like to send the congratulations
To my motherfuckin' self
Look, hol' up


[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Lacin' up these size 10, steppin' on you wisecracks
Started with a small vision, now the screen on iMax
Big dawg vicious, God my witness
I ain't with the weird shit, so I keep it all bidness
HB paid the cost, I got the shit ringin' off
See the smoke from the exhaust when I peel out kid
Ten plus in this shit and they still doubt Hit
I should hand niggas a contract, like fill out this
Went through the seasons I had to stand the weather
One man band, y'all better band together, I'm 'bout bands
Doubts in my flame, nigga I doubt that
My nigga see an enemigo, they gon' hop out fast
Look back in the race and get passed up quick
Pushin' at my own pace, still lappin' you jits
I wasn't even surprised when you ass jumped ship
We know niggas who do the most, ain't done shit

[Interlude 2: Hit-Boy]
It's all bidness, no feelings
Get money, keep winnin'
Look, hol' up

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy & BENNY THE BUTCHER]
Gotta clean up the mud, I ain't touchin' the feds
Then we high like a nigga standin' up on pegs
We ain't givin' out the info, don't ask us
Mask up, flee the scene in a black truck
It's bad luck, fuckin' with squad
We mind your ass to the mob
The Flex, droppin' a bomb, I had to take the batton
Nip' told the world this shit is a marathon, you could sell a billion first week, I ain't scared of y'all (I got this)
Let's go
Bulletproof the Benz, lost a few friends
But made so much, hoes think I play for the Redskins
Blowin' smoke out of gas masks (Yeah)
Baggin' dough up in trashbag, streets'll double cross like hashtags
Pressure wasn't shit to a nigga, I invited it
They askin' what I did for the hood, I inspired it
Fiends taste the dope 'fore they fire it, who inquirin'?
Chasin' down money was tirin', now they wire it
Gun smoke in my clothing, they can never say I folded
Put a nigga to sleep and then give his mother roses
50K in a sofa, got me laughin' like the Joker
You suite the bitch, been two week with you and broke it
They ask my motivation, of course it's hunger
I walked out of 2019 with Jordan numbers
Record label tryna sign me, that's when we lost each other
'Cause I'm really not a rapper, I just talk to hustlers
The Butcher, ah

Hope it make a big mess (Hope it make a big mess)
Niggas see through, like they bathin' in Windex, uh
Came a long way but ain't no celebrations
Lead by example, lead by demonstration
Might've been scarred but shit I never was scared
Had to put on my best, this occasion is rare
Countdown from top square, ball drop
Givin' bitches up, this ain't adoption
Can't trust 'em, they be talkin'
Singin' like Randy Watson, nigga (Randy Watson, nigga)

Charged up, full throttle
Cold like Colorado, keep it pushin' that's the motto
Ranges and Benzos off the lot (Off the lot)

Now I got a hellcat on my wrist

Shit I thought I lost it all but I found myself

Show your colors in true time and the rest get revealed

So in my life it's more of a reason to eat and break the cycles
I dropped pride then came clarity
Look how it helped me with my sincerity
Blossom with what was near to me
Ponder about my life from this Benz seat
Van Elle and Dior, that make appearance when the lames creep
Such a leak from 10 deep
We learn to swim through doubt
Like when bitches in Hit crib, done pulled the swimsuits out
If you ain't us, we gon' sniff you out
Snatch a bottle of Mo' and big double an' I'ma lift you out
We ain't worried 'bout the niggas speakin' down
Knowing heavy be the crown and you'll niggas know such

Those were the reasons why

Deep down in a hole
I used to crawl

That maybe I was in on it?

No, of course they didn't

Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead and gone from they families

From kickin' in the front door to countin' up the backends
And we ain't goin' back to broke 'cause that's past tense

Go ahead, tell 'em wait awhile
Prayin' for all my dawgs to be here, but they ain't
Can't even make 'em proud
Pain like an anchor, tryna hold me down
Cut deep like a razor and I ain't got a towel
I miss my niggas dead and gone, they was just seein' some shit, waitin' on me
And I pray the same day the Lord take my soul, y'all at the gates waitin' on me
Cut deep when you real hot, take 'em 'long and I hate it
But I gotta charge to the game, ain't nobody save me
And you know lots came with the game

Uh-huh
You know we came from nothin', straight out the dirt with this shit
Yeah

[Verse]
Ain't shit changed since I got on the road and I stopped fuckin' with you
Wouldn't speak the same language since you got that other nigga
Ain't prayin' for no angels, need a bankroll, let the money heal me
Carrying all this pain, fuck it, I ain't gettin' no demonic spirits
Can't even post up in the hood, there's always gon' be shots fired
Don't love the opposition, they just hate niggas from my side
My CEO told me, ""Stay out the hood,"" probably hurt mine
Wish granny was still livin', she never seen how I turned out
Easy to see the world war when you watching from the birdhouse
Mama ain't know she raised a star 'til the day they let your son out
If I went there when I started, bet I'm somethin' now
Came from nothin', but gave the whole world somethin' to talk about
Ayy, fuck a room and let that nigga tell him from the horse's mouth
[?] died April 1st, but it wasn't nothin' to laugh about
I heard your cousin killed you, I can't wait until they let him out
The same ones you grew up with the same ones that take you out
Can't love these bitches, keep it pimpin', focus on the paper route
Fucked up, I'm left with all these memories of my dawgs up underground
Some days I feel just like I'm popped, just wanna ball above the rim
Won't see me down my faith in God, I put all the weight on him
A couple niggas I know died tryna rob to feed their families
John died right in my eyes at 17, I won't forget it
Who would've thought when I got shot it would've came from my daddy?
Came from nothing, not what you used to, so I know you don't understand me
A nigga switch up on the usual, I don't believe in the text
These niggas stepped up what you do, fuck the hype and probably [?] us
We ain't friends, I can't shake your hand 'cause I don't want your hand
Fuck the fake love, get on FaceTime with my daughter and get it genuine
You would think I'm layin' in a casket, how they feelin' me?
Anything you ever wanted, ask me, you ain't gotta steal from me
'Cause I ain't got no time for no nigga with her Tennessee
We glow and now they know my name from Italy to Tennessee

Shake dice or shake your ass
We all do what we gotta do to pass
In this world where they say:
""It's not personal, it's business""
Moving numbers from account to count
Keeping secrets in an offshore fount
But my money is quick to count
I got four dollars to my name

You can do a lot with four American dollars
You can do a lot with four American dollars

You get to have
You will still die
And that's the only thing
You gotta have boots
If you wanna lift those bootstraps

You can do a lot with four American dollars
You can do a lot with four American dollars


[Verse 2]
Numbers on a screen mean nothing to me
We're on the same boat but different seats
And how could you ever believe
""It's not personal it's business""
You were living in a cashless dream
Acting like it ain't obscene
Can't fool me with that old routine
Still got four dollars to my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Cash money's going so out of style
Don't worry baby
Gonna be enough to go around
How 'bout I give you three
And I only keep one for me?

No matter how much
(You can do a lot with four American dollars)

And that's the only fact

You gotta have boots

Doing all those things that you would soon regret (Overtime)

Dark black soot filled the air

[Intro]
꿈의 섬으로 (꿈의 섬으로)
La isla bonita

[Verse 1]
Blue skull 처럼 눈부신 이 파도가 (¿Cómo se llama?)
손을 뻗어 우리들을 감싸고 있네 (Yeah, yeah)
태양은 바로 머리 위에 빛나고 (또 빛나고)
따스한 햇살을 전해주네 'cause I feel good

[Refrain]
망원경을 가져와 저기 수평선을 봐 (수평선을 봐)
우아하게 보이는 shinin' 보석처럼 (Now I see the light)
믿을 수 없겠지만
My dreams come true
설명할 수 없지만 알게 돼
You're the only one (Hey, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
구름 위로 달려갈까
아님 헤엄쳐 가볼까
너무 궁금해 비밀의
그 곳이 난


[Chorus]
꿈의 섬으로 환상의 세계로
(세계로 세계로 세계로)
우린 날아갈 거야 꿈의 섬으로
Ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh
Ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh, ahh
La isla bonita, la isla bonita
(La niña bonita)

[Verse 2]
La isla bonita 아름다운 이 곳에 다다르면
먼저 두 팔 벌리고 공기를 만끽하려해
It is so fresh, fresh
날아가고 있어 미지의 그 섬으로
두려움이 없는 그 곳에 다가가네
슬픔 걱정 없이 행복하게 숨쉬고
푸른 빛 바다가 넘실대는 낙원으로

[Refrain]
비행선을 타고 가 저기 하늘 위를 봐 (하늘 위를 봐)
희미하게 보이는 bright light ocean처럼 (And day and night)
믿을 수 없겠지만
Our dreams come true
설명할 수 없지만 알게 돼
You're the only one (You're the only one)

[Bridge]
하얀 물결이 밀려와 두 발 살며시 적시면
크리스탈처럼 빛나는 미래
꿈에서만 보이던 그 세계
구름 위로 달려갈까 아님 헤엄쳐 가볼까
너무 궁금해 비밀의 그 곳이 (Hey!) 난

[Chorus]

Huh, a-yo

[Verse 1: Rome Streetz]
Fuck letters (Fuck), had a thousand pills in the mail box (Uh-huh)
Heaven to hell, eight poppy state in the jail stop (I've been there)
Put two grams, then half a brick on a scale top (What up?)
Went from empty pockets that was popped to havin’ a lot (I did)
Then I elevated, niggas minds still trapped in the box
Kick the door down, they had no patience to Jimmy The Lock
Had a metro card, now it's foreign car keys
Simon Leviev, I finesse your skis outta all her cheese (My enemies)
Ignorant indians always gon' outnumber the chiefs
How a lost nigga gonna lead? (How?)
Poppin’ percocet pills with fentanyl, they don't want weed
My homie doin' fed time, his custy OD
Free loot, give the rivals no time to regroup
Keep loot in the pocket of my low ski-suit (Cash)
Niggas be frontin', don't think everything that you see true (Nah)
Eve listened to the snake and made the bitch eat fruit
Better stay wise, live spelled backwards, is evil (Uh-huh)
I'm only here for the green paper with the Eagle (Ahh, yeah)
They follow me, study all my game to be iller
Nigga, I been a Trail Blazer like Damian Lillard
Better get focused, but you know this, the frame of the picture
I aim to be richer, keep the ting-ting with the switcher (Grr)
My first fanbase was the pill poppers and sniffers
Now this new shit that I got more loot ready for a nigga


[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got a Ghostface Killah train the Gio, Gorillaz on Nat Geo
Pushin' P at the PO, the only fare is the RICO
We know this here is primo, that snap necks, nonio
No keno, you can bet that I got necks, nosino (Uh-uh)
Now, follow the credo, Gambinos, and pink flamingos
The casino, with some guidos who sippin' on casamigos
Qué rico me amigo, dem tranquilo like muy frio
Pardon my lingo, but OMG, ’’Ayy, ¡Dios mío!'’
My method lethal, a little bit um Paquito
Fittin' all inside Palico, I leave you finished, finito, uh
The meal plan is a million bands, no key though
And freedom with no ''M’', should tell you nothin' for free though
That's wild boy, no Steve-O, magnetism, magneto (Uh)
A star lord, but people gon' tell you it's just my ego
Or, my black machismo (Or my black machismo), note for the speaker
That's the keynote, these rappers out here whinin', that's the Pinot (That's the Pinot)

[Chorus: Rome Streetz]
If it makes sense, then dollars what it gotta be (Uh-huh)
Puttin' plenty paper in my pockets, it's the policy (Stack into my pocket)
Protect your neck, keep the TEC on me, it's technology (Grr, grr, grr)
No apology, it's just a pile of G's (Nigga)
If it makes sense, then dollars what it gotta be (Uh-huh)
Puttin' plenty paper in my pockets, it's the policy (Stack into my pocket)
Protect your neck, keep the TEC on me, it's technology (Grr, grr, grr)

[Intro: BabyBoy]
A child is born
Through love, joy
Blood, sweat, tears, and all of that
He doesn't know who he wants to be
He doesn't need to
Do you?

[Verse 1: BabyBoy]
Put down the gun
Nobody came from your day
No, it ain't fun
All this time spent out your pocket
You lost it
All this time spent making dockets
Exhausted, exhausted

[Skit]
Babyboy - ""Nah nah alright, I will I will. Alright I love you, bye.""
Loui - ""Look bruh, you good?""
Babyboy - ""Yea...just my mom bruh.""
Loui - ""She was mad at you?""
Babyboy - ""Nah she was just talking 'bout some shit bruh. I don't know man, she's always trying to treat me like a lil kid.""



Part 2: DAWN

[Verse 1: Loui]
Yea, I’m getting too old for this bullshit
I know that something gonna have change
Something gonna have to change
I just a need little space
I’m always losing my place
Always looking for the finer things
Can someone give me a little patience
If you want a girl then just take it
Left my heart broken Vacant

[Chorus: Jody Fontaine]
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you want to learn to give and give back some more
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you never want to live like that
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you want to learn to give and give back some more
Say you never want to live like that, like that

[Verse 2: Mick Anthony]
I could see it in your eyes
I could see it in the way you lie
Yes I'm fucked up
And I'm faded
But I'm waiting
For my graces
To arrive, to arrive
Mama, do you wanna,  go home?


[Verse 3: Jody Fontaine]
It’s catastrophic tragic nonsense swimming down the block
Bent & crawling like my skin after those capsules I had popped
Mouth foaming leaning back feeling empty I’m in shock
I hit the deck my shirt wet and it was only 4 o clock
I’m just a sick twisted piece of shit who hates to impose
I ain’t start off on a high horse but look how I rose
I’m just a flower in the concrete beggin' to grow
Thought they cracked me snapped back on em look how I glow
And if I’ll make it who knows
I’m just tryna get on
Pen moving swift my fingertips worn to the bone
I wish I had a clone
So y’all would leave me alone
Put my heart into the music but you can’t have my soul

[Chorus: Jody Fontaine]
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you never want to live like that no more
Say you want to learn to give and give back some more

I need a bunch of gore
I shoot a slasher film with all the whores

Watch me make a cameo
Watch me put my city on
Make it back to Mexico
All those times I always doubted
But I knew I wanted more
I was born young at the wrong time
But I worked hard yea full time
Worked hard on my grind
Can’t stop me this war time
Still shined on my time
It’s fuck love, fuck Peace signs
Fuck you and your bloodline
I’m getting what’s all mine


[Verse 3: Jody Fontaine]
I got 50s, 40s, 30s, 20s
I was born to be a star
Ford Explorer on Forgiato's
Know my mama loved that car
And I’m counting all of my sins
Fore that rapture blow and we part
Rollin' big fingers with Benji
And he askin' where did we start
And he askin' what we chasin'
Tryna shake back and be great
Feelin' vacant, needin' maintenance
He said watch the breaths that you take
I’m so glad that Manny ain’t fake
I’m so glad Jabbarr stayed down
I’m so glad that Derek ain’t hate
It’s like 10 heads in this crown, yea

So much braver than me

The wrong notes
And I’ll never let you know
I’m crazy
I hate me
For you I’ll break the rules tho
I hope that you’re free
I pray that you’re free


[Verse 2: Jody Fontaine]
You just not what I need but it’s okay
I don’t really want you to go away
Keep you in my back pocket
No comment
Switch the topic
Girl you hot like the tropics
Just being honest
But I’m following my conscience
I gotta stop it
Say no
Hot girl baby
Hit me when you turn cold
Don’t stop until I see your veins start to show

I like breakfast at Tiffany’s
You be where the pigeons be
Ya mama’s in ministry
She had you at 17
Stares from the family
She fled with her dignity
That woman’s the shit 2 me

This is for the friends
This is for the family

[Verse 1: Jody Fontaine]
Always saw myself as less than perfect, lil less than worth it
Lookin' at what’s on the surface, wondering if I deserve it
Mama I know you been hurtin'
Landlord kicked us out and put us on the block
Then you put me on the block
That’s that shit that had me shocked
Now I’m in the meltin' pot
But soon I’m gon' be at the top
Then the family on my jock
Wondering if they can get a callback
I was just a lost boy, so fuck you niggas, fallback
Tighter than a bra strap
I don’t need your support
Man this music like a sport
Take the ball across the court
Since I hopped up off the porch
I been flowin' through the motions
Winnin' season I been coastin'
See my niggas and I’m toastin'
We made it out the bottom of the barrel
Opps at the door singin' fuckin' Christmas carols
Bars so clean, you would think that they were sterile
Really made it out the mud, no more livin' life in peril


[Verse 2: Babyboy]
Why oh why oh why, do I try so much?
Do I die so much in my own dreams?
Why oh why oh why, can’t I fly away?
Try another day
I might need to stay-ay-ay with you here
Try to get this mind of mine clear
Mind of mine clear, yeah

[Verse 3: Jody Fontaine]
I got treasures in my mind, I need security
I need purity
Freedom from the tyranny, my futures never clear to me
Don’t believe they hearin' me
7 billion people not a single one put fear in me
Rap the only cure for me
Preachin' like a politician, but I’m on a different mission
Tryna take my brothers to the top, because we all gifted
Just tryna speak into your heart and get your soul lifted
And if I ever let you down, I’m praying for forgiveness
AG, always grateful for the force that made you
Word is bond, I never stray, you know my verses reign true
Virtuous and steadfast, we gon' see what that fame do
If I don’t get it this time, can I get a take two?
Can I get a take two?
If I don’t get it this time, can I get a take two?
You know I need a breakthrough
You know my verses reign true
If I don’t get it this time, bitch I

[Verse 2: Jody Fontaine]
Play me a verse from that AG shit
Want my pockets so fat that my pants don't fit
Flashbacks of mama posted with the hands on hips
Sayin' ""You don't pay no damn rent so cut the rappin' and shit.""
I stormed off grabbed my toothbrush and my laptop
Chucked the deuce at moms I had to blast off
I was 17 the first time I touched the asphalt
That’s around the first time I ever heard the grass talk
All respect to moms I know she raised me to be upper echelon
But she don’t know she hurt me more than anyone
Gave me tough skin and a hell of a cold tongue
But all I  wanted was some love from my mama, I got none
So now I’m out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
My pockets eatin' but my soul empty
Throw up a brick I box you out like I’m Joel Embiid
Then I take it to the rack cause I’m bold as can be
Don’t get me gassed up
Records movin' out the garage it’s hard to pass up
Loui got a gig in the morning go wake his ass up
Trying to deliver this album and shake the bag up
Already got my stats up
It’s time to get the cash up
Time to get my mack up
I acted in no back up
Slid to Macarthur
Ced & Jaelun had me mashed up
If you ever crossed me it’s nothing for us to patch up
Just hope that you don’t catch me when I’m strapped up

Who I wanna be
Everything I love
Everything I preach

Yuh, yuh
Ay what you on tonight?
Nah yea it's good I'm finna come through
Nah I told you I was coming back, haha
Nah see there you go again
Ain't nobody with no bitch bro, why you always trippin off me?
See I be trying to see you, I be trying to show you love
But you just be bugin' it's all good though
Yea I'm finna be there, I'm up the block

[Verse 1: Mick Anthony]
I don't know what you want me to say
Is she my friend or should I stay away
So stop playing, stop playing, stop playing
So stop playing all these games
I'll stop taking all those blames
If you don't love me all the same
So stop playing
Said your daddy wasn't even really home
Now I'm on the road and It's feelin' cold
Where's my heart baby
I don't even know
Where's my heart baby
I don't even fuckin' know


[Verse 2: Loui]
Remember the first time that we fucked
Remember the first time we made love
Told me we bonded different
You say you felt something that you haven’t before
Baby you what I wanted more
Baby we vibe yea you know
Girl your mind is different
And anybody that tell you that it ain’t girl is hoe
You treat me like a superhero
I’m just a villain
You say I fuck you differently
Well baby let me hear it
My dick is in the building
Your pussy feel exquisite
Just ride me to nightfall
Don’t be so timid, don’t be so timid

[Verse 3: Babyboy]
I don’t know why you get defensive
I ask you why you mad, you roll your eyes
And say ""I meant it""
And I ain't got time to play around and sit on fences
Wish I could rewind and say the things I didn't mention
Like, I'm so grateful for every single lesson
The way you sit me down you study my dimensions
The way you make me feel like our love will never lessen
When I say I need you, you ask me if i meant it
I meant it
I meant it
I meant it
I meant it


[Outro: Jody Fontaine]
And I start
On my way to where you at
Am I coming through the front or am I coming round the back
It’s been 20 thousand hours since I sat you in my lap
And told you you gon' be my last
I was keeping it a stack
I love you
I love you
I mean for real I love you

Uh, my trial and tribulations have turned me to a man that I wanted to be
Something bigger than me
Something that I could pass down my family tree
I got the game by the chokehold, I’ll never let them breathe
And I can never sleep if the suns out
I took the pain and made my own route
That’s what I’m talking 'bout
Cause if ain’t nobody proud of me, I am
And shoutout to myself 'cause I did it with no guidance

[Verse 2: Babyboy]
Who’s ya father? Who’s ya man?
Who would bother to shake your hand?
When they call they won't talk
They just listen to your thoughts
Settle down, sit and breathe
Pray the day light, never leaves

And the sun won't set it all
And the sun won't set it all
And the sun won't set it all

[Verse 3: Jody Fontaine]
No more dancin' with demons
Won’t take no chances with demons
No more tryna get even
This insanity seeping
Into these words that I'm reading
Outta this Holy Bible fuck it’s hot
Praying for that oxygen
That spirit make me Diddy bop but
I just wanna keep my head
I can’t be trusted with lead
At least that’s what my shrink said
But she live in my head 2
Insurance won’t let me get
The help that I need to quit
Hating my existence
Cause my brain is like a prison
But the warden fucked up
Ain’t no pads on my walls
I try to claw until my fingertips bald
And I been having withdrawals
So now I’m itchin' for a feelin'
In this substance and my aura
Masked by this scent of green
Fuck it’s pungent
And I just can’t stop thinking 'bout the people I grew up with
Who all grew outta me, this memory is what I’m stuck with
And I just can’t stop thinking 'bout the people I grew up with
But nigga fuck it

[Verse 1: Braille]
Don't get me wrong when I make this song
I'm just a messenger for inter ventilation from my chimney with this fire
I'm spittin' if I pop em in the mouth
Pop the trunk and throw the body in
Or get my posse involved
Kamikaze and the obvious reaction they expect from me
Just let it be
I keep em guessing and they ain't got telepathy
Cause I turn the other cheek It's not a weakness
It takes a bigger man to put together all the pieces
My choices will affect my daughter nephews and nieces
I don't wanna infect em with any of my diseases
So ceasefire chill we got children in the mix
So I can't go aping wild out like gorillas in the mist
Rebuild until my life gets better than before
Connected to the resurrector let him settle the score on my behalf
So I can bring destruction and wrath
But is it worth getting sidetracked off the right path?

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
I feel vibrant how do you survive it
When they start wildin' out and get violent
But I've been on this path my father has taught me that
Characters revealed on the field and how you react
I feel like real life's better than what a pill might do
So I press on even when it don't feel right
Been laughed at stabbed in the back
Spit on talked about didn't know until after the fact
And I ain't trying to get even Stevens
Let them stone them
Saw the heavens open up and felt the Lord
Hold 'em console 'em
I can't condone 'em
They are not understanding me I can't control 'em
So I let go of my insanity


[Verse 3: Beleaf]
You had me out of obligation
I remember walking home from road to station
Cause you kicked me out of our place and
Spitting on my face and carry on your case and
Lying to the lawyers bout the truth so you can save face and
Put that fear in me so I wouldn't be complacent
Used to dream about your death and your funeral arrangements
I'm the first born you made all your mistakes with
Beat me as a child as man I am patient
I heard abuse can be contagious
But I left that in my past like slaves under racists
It's crazy cause even though we still see him
It's easy to forgive when you know you got freedom

[Outro: Beleaf]

Samurai Baby!

Hey hey

[Verse]
Bitch I’m the man, nobody comparing themselves to the man
Run it like Stan, building my company straight from ground
Knew imma make it like Bobby boy did
Came with a sword and all of my clan
Pouring these lyrics like ocean of tears
Stretch out your bowl, anointing thy self
Gather your children, tell all your friends
Samurai coming to take off some heads
Spell out my name at the back of their necks
T is for time, a moment it takes
I for issues I came address
M for multi, a jack of all trades
I came herе rap, can also can write
E for ego, a little of that
L is for light, I’m lеading the way
Climb up the ladder with a rifle in hand
Waiting for heaven to call out my name
Angels and demons, they battled for me
Rise to the top like pressure from steam
Breaking the wall they set before me
I am a prophet that came before me
New in a body, the angel of peace
Using my words like walking through breeze
Protecting myself in a valley of fiends
Gather up courage, the monster within
Jiggle up, write it up, my scriptures within
Started this shit with a word and a dream
Do it for people who look up to me
Thinking my future was set before me
I shook up the dice and drew up a 6
I’m a legend, just know it and live
Wipe out a rapper that thought he was me
I’m the one that stood before kings
They bow at my presence, my wisdom they seek
Pushing myself with pillars of dreams
I wrote up this lyrics like watching a film
Making an album that’s preaching peace
Way of the Samurai, you walking with me
Releasing the second, a journey it’s been
Struggled in bliss that many won’t see
They open their mouths, like reptiles in heat
They saying their pieces, not grabbing a piece
They tryin so hard to hating on me
I am so blessed, they leeching on me
Prayers and love I'm learning give
Cheers to the fans that stood beside me
Sharing my music, my ronins they be
Showing the world what wonders I did
They told me to sit, said Afro is big
I’m trying my best but never received
Hitting the ground from falling from dreams
Wiping the dirt, off of my chin

My modern Prometheus

[Verse 1: Chris & Chris & Flo]
Deal with the two mysteries
Of creation, life and death
I wait for a new life to come
I wait to smell the breath
The world to me's a secret
Which I desire to divine
Something is at work in my soul
Which I cannot assign

It doesn't beat for you no more

For the dream is long long gone
Myself is a place where no one
Wants to stay for long

Never did fields bestow a more plentiful harvest
That withered so slow
He who believes his native town to be the world, may rest assured
But I learned the loss of hope and innocence
And both are not to be cured

I don't dare to feel

Though we outnumber the few of those who reign

In my blistering dreams

I'd rather keep it real with ya
Real hot girl shit, ah

Helluva made this beat, baby
Huh

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right

[Verse 1]
Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that
You tryna make me somethin' that I ain't, and I ain't with that (Nah)

[Verse 2]
I got my mind on gettin' paid, we ain't spoke in some days
He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a ""probably""
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'
Since you wanna test them waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you think this shit get better with another bitch, go get her (Go and get her)
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help ya

The sample comes from Al Green’s version of “Love & Happiness.”Brooklyn, New York, Flatbush to be specific
Is the topic of the composition, so people, if it
Offends, I recommend you get off, you soft tush
Come down, come around to the Bush, the Bush
Live in the Bush, Flatbush, that is the place
Where I rest with the blessed, don't jest, it is a waste
To try, you might die, so I abort the mission
Try to fight, you might end up in critical condition
Cause we don't take shorts, not here, not in the Bush
And if you wanna get around, you gotta know how to push
The boys make noise and the girls be slappin curls out the head
Try to fight back, black, you get dead
In the Bush
The Bush

We got the brothers with the heads in dreads
On the corners like pigeons
Smokin marijuana but it's their religions

We got the others on the pipe tip
Goin on the flight trip
Soon on the toon, your mother will right-grip
Basin up the world, chasin up the girls
The fire got too high till you're facin up your curls
Now you're burned, learned your lesson
Stop messin with the crack, black, cause now look how you're dressin
Chokin and totin on the pipes and the woolers
While the dealers are your friends with the Benz plus medullahs
And rings, they're kings because of what they push
And they're part of the heart in the Bush, the Bush


I'm Special Ed, and yes, I'm takin it all
The school that I attend is Ersamus Hall
Live in Flatbush, yes, I'm on
No, I'm not a god, but my word is bond
I got the knowledge, wisdom, understandin
Not fussy, but demandin
No, I'm wise, understand
Mess with me, I break your hand
Stop your heart, take your breath
With the diagnose of death
Remove your brain from your skull
Make ya dumb, make ya dull
Sow you up and cut your hair
Put you in a science fair
Tell em that your name is John
Make you a phenomenon
Freak of nature, make em hate ya
Not a girl will ever date ya
So step off, because you're soft, and I'm a soldier
Go get your crew, and you can tell em what I told ya
Tell em how I burned ya, how you got dissed
Then form a line, so I can add em to the list

If you come to the Bush keep a low pro
Cause you might catch a knot or a shot or a blow
To the face in this place, if you base you will be broken
Comin off the train you gotta pay another token
What this means is, you pay for your protection
Pay a fee and never see a reflection
Again, my friend, or rather foe, you know the deal
Either hear or feel
Choose one, but at least you got an option
Be my son or be up for adoption
Why in heaven's name would you diss?
Do you wanna kiss a fist?
We can do this, properly, you're on my property
This ain't a game, but you can say it's a monopoly
Cause I control the total supply, and you're the user
Akshun makes the cuts and Howie Tee is the producer
We make it or break it, so take it just like that
Yes yes y'all, we're all from Flat-

[Verse 1]
I was like ""Good gracious ass is bodacious""
Flirtatious, trying to show faces
Waiting for the right time to shoot my steam
Waiting for the right time to flash them keys
I'm leaving, please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feeding
No deceiving, no-nothin' up my sleeve, no teasing
I need you to get up-up on the dancefloor
Give that man what he asking for
I feel like busting loose
And I feel like touching you (Ah-ah)
Can't nobody stop the juice?
So, baby, tell me what's the use?
I said

[Chorus]
It's getting hot in here (So hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

I am, I am, I am, I wanna take my clothes off

Give a little bit ah-ah

And a sprinkle of ah-ah (Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya ah-ah
Girl, baby, make it ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
With a winner so, baby, you can't lose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
Dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like ""Girl, I think my butt gettin' big""

[Chorus]

So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

A knot made of a thousand thorns (I'm going deeper down)
Strikes and wanders through the ruins (I'm going underground)
Everything that was certain i'm going deeper down
(Turned into a pale thought i hear no sound)

[Pre-Chorus]
People come and go Metamorphosis of the soul
In a deafening silence Metamorphosis of the heart
Quick steps, lying words Metamorphosis of the world
Wheezing breath a song arises
Every strand of hair falls fast as a snake
In a destructive vortex

[Chorus]
Painting the walls of my dreams
In a new home made of all hopes in the light
(Feeling the call of thе moon)
Painting the walls of my dreams
In a new homе made of all hopes in the light
(Feeling the call of the moon)

[Verse 2]
Maybe it can sew it up I'm going deeper down
The artist and the serious part (I hear no sound)
In the meanwhile I struggle with myself
In this invisible world I live
Destroying all I have ever wanted
All I ever desired

If I could, I'd rewind back the hands of time
Foul shit, like when po' shot Porter with his 9
Like a child being blind to the ways of mankind
QB, the streets raised me, my whole state of mind
I just fall back, reminisce on this sometime
A lot of niggas pull snake moves, fuck it it's their loss
Write it, I live it, then place my pivot in my Air Force
Credit get felon, three strikes, fighting these jail wars
Niggas going up north, we runnin' in their whores
Inhale and exhale, a smoke and a swirl
Ol' heads shooting boy, gives ahead, sniff girl
Getting rocked on the block, you off point when you earl
When Shan and Marley Marl was touchin' the world tour
And I pulled a jux, that's how I got my first pair of Jordans
See I never chose this life, this life chose me
Ghetto apostle, soundtracks to the street

[Hook: Cormega]
Time to unify the belt
Time is money, utilize your wealth
Fate is something you decide yourself
Life is what you make it, you remind yourself
If you forget it, in the end you define yourself

[Verse 2: Cormega]
My name is spoken in places they weighin' coke
And if actions speak louder than words, how the fuck do you explain these vocals
My fate is chosen in unison when my baby growin'
Not facin' numerous cases, them days are over
I shed enough tears to measure the rains of Noah
When they subside, its clear, I'm much wiser
Some rhyme of drug tide, but very few can match my residue
Or resume, Mega's the truth
A lot of hearts get tested when the feds come through
Niggas who did work start revealin' like forensic experts
Lyrically I'm humidity, you sweat in my verse
It's so dope you need a mass when you measure it, what Mega spit
My phlegm was sent to the lab for evidence, and deemed inadmissible
I never flip, I represent to thoroughest weather in the belly of [?]
When asked for a real nigga to stand, I'm who the ghetto sent

You cowards movie role, never let them [?] blow
You cowards faker than fools gold, the truth told
Nines on our dicks, we don't do those
Never had to, you lyin' 'bout little shit like that
Imagine real shit, shit that can get you clapped

To me, you niggas live as Smurfs, turn to blue when the gungle the work

(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

[Verse 1]
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
And no matter how you try to hide, it states your case
Now a frown will bring your spirits down to the ground
And never let you see the good things all around
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind won't blow

[Chorus]
But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

[Verse 2]
Wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it waking and shaking and safe and sound?
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind won't blow


[Chorus]
But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Life is on your case

[Bridge]
Yes it is, yeah
This world can't shake me (This world can't shake me)
Bad times can't make me sad
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

[Verse 3]
You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow, I'll feel the same old way
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake me, my heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feeling bad

All these things help
Because they give you an insight
To your inner self
Have mercy

The one that like to go to parties
One that like to dress up and be cool
And look pretty, on ego-trips and all this

So now, hey, y'all, tryin' to tell you

You gotta make some beauty

Come up from the tub all wild, look like a four-eyed pig from Australia
You're like a wine-soaked varicose genitalia
You'll be a sloth-like crook who likes to fail to presevere
Give me a boat, Bermuda tricycle, I'll disappear
Watch what you say 'cause I'll leave you in the woods near the horse
And we'll leave you there naked and let nature takes its course

John-John, you think that I'm a hooker and you try to book her
Everybody's wrong about what turns me on
He thinks that I'm a hooker, she thinks that I'm a john
Okay

[Verse 2]
Been drivin' all night and day just tryin' to find Route 66
All I found was a couple teenage boys tryin' to sell their dicks
Ate 4,448 Flintstones Kids to get my fix
We can dock our foreskins and get a real viscous mix
When my first son turns seven I'm gonna give him LSD and see what he says
Then I'll toss him to his mama and let him suck on some breasts

[Chorus]

You're like the Prince of Darkness doing patty cakes in the pig sty

Your brain'll be expandin' when God's kingdom comes

Got a concussion from an apple, make him clueless in a nine-to-five grind

Of Georgia, searchin' for illegal goods
The growl of his engine was his battle cry

But in the end, he got the loot
Ain't a man alive that can say that he got away

Of that rascal Rumbler and his pickup trucks
Kicked him out and took his badge away

Little did he know that his luck was about to change

And I found out the hard way that the pathway to her heart
Is not through her nose

'Cause they rotted out and they're not all there

Jumping out a trash can in Congolese cowboy clothes?
And like a deer transfixed by headlights
The bumper crushed his head while I God damn froze

Twenty-five to life deep in the swamps of the LSP
There's no way out, but you can have a chance to feel free
Old Burl Cain's been known to put on a show
I'm gonna take my chance at the Angola rodeo
So while I do my time I'm gonna rope me some bovines
And be a king for a day, if it's only for a little while

[Verse 2]
I'll be an all-'round cowboy ropin' like Cadillac Jack
Ride a mustang 'round the ring, no saddle, it's called bareback
So when they open up that chute, I'll take the chit right off that brute
I'll have my commissary stocked with all my rodeo loot

[Verse 3]
Well, I found myself starin' down the nose of a Brahma bull
I got weak in my knees and the sweat started to pool
But he stopped, it seemed, just chasin' me around the ring
I shot up that wall just searchin' for somewhere to cling
I saw blood drippin' down his horn, I knew then that I'd been gored
Hell, anything's better than sittin' in a cell bein' bored

[Verse 4]
I spent sixteen weeks just healin' in infirmary
Compared to Camp J that was quite a luxury
""So, doctor, please, get me some morphine
And go easy on me, buddy, 'cause those beasts can't conquer me""
You know I'll be here next year, I got nothin' left to fear

In twenty-five quarters and two-thirds, a broken home
Out one night with his mouth wide open wide
He let it all out, you could hear him for miles
The full moon shined down his slithering throat
And everyone could tell that his retarded spirit
Spoke a drivel that was cursing the ominous voice of God
And we told you, you are

His twisted mind was filled with dirt
And his poor, naked, shriveling body
Was just a shell
And he rode an inbred vessel, exploring
An unwanted journey through the middle passage
Into the inner depths of the putrid banks of hell
There's no turning back now this time, little cracker boy
Because you just had, you just had

Okay, my day was amazin', her booty shots graze me
She said, ""All the gyms closed"", so she been feelin' lazy
She been late night snackin', but shawty still my baby (Pop, poppin', chill)
Several watches later, I still rock a Rollie (Rock a Rollie)
I'm prayin' for the dead, I'm prayin' for my homies (Rest in peace)
I sleep by a scale and everybody know it (Know it)
I hate it when a pretty girl start snorin' (Stop that shit)
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""You a lucky man"" (Lucky man)
How you gon' forget you spent a hunnid grand? (Spend that shit)
Life must be good, it must be great as fuck (Great as fuck)
I'm from where a nut'll cost you eighty bucks (Southside)
Mask on in thе club, I make 'em rake it up (Rakе it up)
He came outside, he thought mosquitoes ate him up (Grrah, grrah)
This is for A-Town, make 'em take a bow (Take a bow)
Can't fuck with you bitches, used to date a clown (Date a clown)
Yeah, I want my cake and wanna eat it too, spend it too
I get what you get just for an interlude (A interview?)
I might cop a yacht just to post a pic (Poppin' champ')
Sleepers spin your block 'til he get motion sickness (Rrahh)

Nineteen years old
Life in front of you
Everything on hold
Feels like you're balanced on a wire
Do you risk it all right here?
You have a fear of being discarded
But the unguarded are the ones
They say, ""Find love""

[Chorus]
People say, ""Live in the moment""
But the moment seems so narrow sometimes
People say, ""Live in the moment""
But the moment looms so large sometimes

[Verse 2]
You've been hurt before, but who hasn't?
You feel insecure, but who doesn't?
It's all or nothing now
How do you decide?
You're overstrung and expectant
You feel strong
You feel new
What should you?
Open up and to yourself be true


[Chorus]
People say, ""Live in the moment""
But the moment seems so narrow sometimes
People say, ""Live in the moment""

Thought I had a degree of resistance
But look at me, seeking assistance
A neutral voice to talk to
A room to walk to in the city
With a painting of a mother, pretty
And another of a father in my eye line
Forcing me to try to take stock
To face up, wind back the clock
Push down the fear
Bring the summer ghosts near

[Chorus]
And when you look back you find you haven't travelled far
You thought you'd changed until reminded who you are
And every piece of you that you volunteer
Just brings the summer ghosts near

[Verse 2]
My folks were just people with their own shit
And god knows there was enough of it
Wrapped up in themselves
Jazz on the shelves
It's how you deal with it
How not to make a meal of it
I watch the dark come, then let it go
I can be the Zen master, I know
Though it's easier when you're shot of it
As opposed to when there's really quite a lot of it


[Chorus]
And when you look back you find you haven't travelled far
You thought you'd changed until reminded who you are
And every piece of you that you volunteer
Just brings the summer ghosts near
Just brings the summer ghosts near

[Verse 3]
This is Spring Bank where I walked years ago
Welcome to a world I used to know
Now it's clearance sales
Saturday hair and nails
Loans and help with debt
Flats over shops to let
Up goes the Hilton
On the corner of Ferensway
The first for a long time
It feels like yesterday
Hard blows the easterly
My grandad was born here
Out on the Anlaby Road

[Chorus]
And when you look back you find you haven't travelled far
You thought you'd changed until reminded who you are
And every piece of you that you volunteer
Just brings the summer ghosts near
Brings the summer ghosts near

Night has descended on this corner of Eden
I'm sending this message to see if you're working
The temperature drops down at the base of the valley
No lights from the houses
I was told you'd escaped to a place past the marker
With a few rolls of film, which I hope you've been using
In the drawer I found the knife that you left
Now unused as a mark of respect
I picture you needing it still
Are you in need of it still?

I re-live the last night when you danced at the party
Your t-shirt was stained and your hair was unruly
You called out the names of the all the people arriving
Laughing at first, before soon disappearing
And the look that you gave to the friends who remained
Was as cold as the stone though they were never to blame
And your face comes to me clear
So much underneath the veneer
I have questions from numerous names
You still run the game
I'm fine if you're asking, well, I'm greyer but settled
With a new set of friends now and a pattern is forming
I never said thank you for all the things that you offered
I'll leave it there, and you can take it or leave it


Up on the hills the fir trees are lit by the moon
Oh, darling it started with a hunger
In the drawer I found the knife that you left
Now unused as a mark of respect
I picture you needing it still
Are you in need of it still?

[Voice 2 - indistinct]
First I was late and I don't know what I finally said to you
Ruin of cold light falling

You always knew the family names that would take a final day to cave
A little more worn away, that is how we figure time

Found a vivid lesson I could take and then I turned the tide
I don't know what I fear or formalise, I'll never know

And you, oh why?
I wanna know what it's still only that I'm aching
Oh, but I'm ok

Faced a little known world, laid something bare
Nullified all the feelings that I ever knew

Lit a fire to stay away, I'm fine now

Hey Irene
Remember that club
Where you used to sing?
Red lampshades
In the booths
Men whispering untruths
Well, they
Tore it down in the spring
And I still remember your voice
I see the band playing
Up there on the stand
And all the smoke and the light
The music loud
And the faces in the crowd

[Bridge]
Was it a dream?
I heard that you moved out of range
Was it something you'd outgrown?
Needed something of your own
I guess, well, everyone’s entitled
To a change

[Verse 2]
The crowd has grown older too
But some of them
They still want a piece of you
They yearn for some golden age
The time of day
I first heard you from the stage
New Years Day
The snow is so thick
But everybody came
For the songs that you sang
The whole glittering shebang
Oh, I see it all
When I hear your name
Last night, I walked there again
The neon city always ageless and unsung
The bars spilled out to the street
The music loud
Different faces in the crowd


[Chorus]
Hey Irene
Where have you been?
Hey Irene
Oh, you're a queen
Hey Irene
Oh, where have you been?

I wanna see the best side of me
I know it is, ooh
Ah, yeah, baby

[Verse 1: Ransom]
Niggas say they outside, but with no place to go
They say, ""Ran', you look young,"" they seein' my face aglow that resembles the greats before
Nas, Big', Face, and Hov
I got a ways to go, but don't you try to give me them flowers that took a day to grow
See, me, I let them haters know
And I tell my people around me, ""I'm tryna feed, you gon' bleed if you take your plate to go""
No, I wanna see the best side of me
But money changes niggas like bribery
And now they tellin' lies to me
Addicted to the life with no sobriety
I had some lost niggas that was guidin' me violently
Now I get teary-eyed when my daughter says bye to me
Silently, I keep it all inside of me
'Cause this is how I gotta be
Yeah, I hope you seein' what is what
Was always full of hatred, couldn't love enough
That's why I said enough's enough
But those who bet against me, I tell them niggas, ""Let's double up""
Dealer cards shuffle up
Pioneers, spillin' your heart on tracks and they shut 'em up
First one through the wall is always gonna get bloodied up
Mhm, and now this runner-up is 'bout to run it up
Too bad, y'all niggas runners-up
Niggas drunk the Kool-Aid, but it's too late 'cause most of these rappin' niggas gon' want a cup
You never seen me buddied up with niggas ain't the same cloth
Takin' pics, huggin' up, tellin' stories that ain't yours
You ain't never blow your gun, cleaned blood off a stained floor
Yeah, you might be holdin' one, but we ain't on the same course
I'm wrappin' up a large P, headin' to the main source
Some crackers in an RV with Berettas and some chainsaws
That's why I spit this pain for
For niggas locked up and she say it ain't yours, brother dead on the same call
'Nother death got your brain paused, we remain flawed
Can't afford to weather the storm 'cause even the rain pour
Nah, we not the same, dog, please let me explain, Lord
If I'm in a crowd of niggas, who you think they gon' aim for?
Yeah, yours truly
So all these fake rappers who swear that war's a movie, I cleared the walls of juvie
Your fearless bars don't move me
You playin' the game, prepared for call of duty
The opps sayin' my name, I hear the calls of duty
The cops put him in chains, I swear them laws is spooky
But I hear the gorgeous groupies
They tell me this my last gasp
I take a deep breath and reassess, I'm in the mirror workin' on my last laugh


[Break: 38 Spesh]
Huh
Ayo, Ran', let me talk on this, my nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
Ayo, turn me up in the headphones, Mayor
Know what I mean?
Ayo

[Verse 2: 38 Spesh]
I remember bein' stressed out about cream
But I ain't never lose sleep, my nigga, what's a visionary without dreams?
I needed rest to see out schemes
Like navigation, my imagination could reroute things
Only kings know about queens
I found mine and I hired a maid to keep the house clean
Now where would I be without fiends?
They took care of me, shit, some even gave me they housekeys
In '03, we was drought kings
Got a warehouse full of things just in case my accounts freeze
A marathon ain't about speed
You gotta pace yourself, this ain't about greed
I told my bitch, ""I'm the man of the house, let your spouse leave""
Y'all niggas'll bite your tongue 'til your mouth bleed
I was just givin' out P's
Now that same safe is full of contracts and house deeds
Huh, I'm dealin' with this anxiety
And all these mental issues that's inside of me
I just wanna see the best side of me
So I go inside of the booth and get privacy
Hire me a private masseuse, reflexology
You gotta seek honest and truth to respect modesty
Beefin' with people that set policies
Knowin' my product's the best quality, but this is how I gotta be
Huh, huh, and I was always told to get rid of beef
Lemon squeeze with a banana clip, that's bittersweet
I'm off balance chemically, mix energy
Y'all mix money and power with bitch tendencies
It take more than money and power to get rid of me
Huh, hmm, and that's probably why I ain't died yet
Couple niggas tried and failed, homie, I'm God sent
It's a process when you a livin' prophet
First, you manifest it, then you visualize it
That's how you turn somethin' subjective into an object
Trust


[Outro: Tearz]
Special tears 'cause nobody gave a fuck, so I cried out in cursive letters
Like these verses'll somehow explain my madness and stitch my soul together
Through special tears with broken fingers, I, I beat demons that had my mind possessed
Then I woke up to scratch marks on my face and bruises all over my chest
He shattered me and show jagged images, I barely recognize who I see
Blood, sweat, and tears, I write the teeth out the devil so he stops eatin' away at me

Putting my trust in these hoes
I should leave that to the pros
You wouldn’t know what Im putting inside of my blunts
And what I put inside of my nose
I’m never home
Chillin wit my so called friends
We get along cause we all are depressed
We get along cause we all are obsessed
The love where you hurt is the best
Look if I could love you know damn well I would
But I can’t keep my lips of the wood
And 11 years old I just had to go jugg
Shopping the thrift but I’m still lookin good
Pray for my niggas that’s still in the hood
Fuckin yo bitch man I do what I should
If I said it I meant I seen it or done  it
2019 man a nigga was cutting
Feelin like everything in my life was gone plummit
Now I get head from her cousin
Feelin like gunna the way that I’m buzzing
You gonna shut up the day that I come up
I got a lotta shit I got to sum up
Sein my momma on lean
Sein my momma pop pills
She wouldn’t pay for the bills
Ima take her to the hills
I need to chill
Smoking a dill wit the boys
Toys
You know we makin some noise
Poised
I got that lil bitch annoyed
Cause when she call me I avoid
I’m on the same shit
Acid,coke,weed I don’t think I got a favorite
This shit is dangerous
Funny how you think that my heart is something to play with

Sitting on her bed mad as fuck because she came quick

My gang, I'ma be attached like a human bone
This bitch wanna get fucked, she gon' get flown
Fuck it, she gon' get flew, beat it 'til it turn blue (Go 'head)
Why got one bitch? Nigga, I can have two
Glock on the hip like one side got glue
Got a little older, then I started hangin' with the Jews
Big bank shawty with a high enough IQ (Ayy)
Big three shots comin' in on the IV
Nigga got coke on the blanket, it's LV
Can't a nigga broker tell me nothin' and that's on God
Niggas at the park lookin' at me like a young god
Bro'nem snatch a nigga chain, call him Rashad
One bitch black, one Asian, now it's Rush Hour
Thick white bitch, same color as some cauliflower
Shit 'bout to get real lit, keep the door closed
Bentley coupe two doors, Bentley truck four doors (Go)
Fill a bitch up with 'bout four holes
She ain't tryna fuck, that's a no-go (Ayy)
Kick the bitch out, that's a waste ho


[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Hey, hey (Keed, talk to 'em)
I know shooters, don't play, yeah (Don't play)
Beat that pussy like a bass, yeah (Boom)
High top shoes, no lace, yeah (No cap)
Bad bitch came from L.A., yeah (L.A.)
Whole lotta shots, no trace (Bang)
I walked in, tryna call my own plays (Tryna call 'em)
Yeah, we got a chopper, chop the top off the Wraith (Chop-chop, chop-chop)
I count a backend just to rock out the stage (Yeah)
Chanel, yeah, for real, yeah (Rockstar)
We drippin' this shit all day (Yeah)
Go get millions, that's accomplishment (Keed, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Lil Keed]
Ain't fuckin' with y'all borin' hoes, no way (No, sir)
I ain't fuckin with y'all, oh no (Let's go)
I send shots where your mother stay (Say what?)
Just 'cause we don't care too
I was geeked out in that Maybach, shit (Yes, sir)
I was drivin' it with no hands, ooh (Skrrt, skrrt)
I hopped in the Hellcat, shit
I'm drivin' it with no hands too (No cap)
I don't lose (No, sir)
No, y'all boys ain't havin' no clue (Let's go), yeah
Smokin' big blunts of White Runtz
While I'm kicking shit with Lil Uzi
I'll take the cam', make a movie, yeah (Yeah)
I'll pop the shit on your order (Pop it)
Niggas ain't playin', we'll lose it
We havin' bad bitches, big booties (Bad bitches, let's go, Keed, talk to 'em)
I'm on some slimeball time (Slatt, slatt)
I bring them slimeballs 'round (Slatt)
I'm with the same ones that pullin' me down (Yeah)
Ain't holdin' up, I'm on the grind
Play with Lil Keed, it's a whole lotta shots
I don't know why she cryin', I don't give a fuck (Uh-uh)
She know I'm a dog, she know I'ma lie (Yes, sir)


[Chorus: Lil Keed]
